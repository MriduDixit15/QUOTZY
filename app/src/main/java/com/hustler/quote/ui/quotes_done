<item>Accident counts for as much in companionship as in marriage.</item>
<item>Circumstances do not make the man ,they reveal him.</item>
<item>Although our inattention can contribute to our lack of total well being ,we also have the power to choose positive behaviors and responses. In that choice we change our every experience of life!</item>
<item>Circumstances may cause interruptions and delays ,but never lose sight of your goal. Prepare yourself in every way you can by increasing your knowledge and adding to your experience ,so that you can make the most of opportunity when it occurs.</item>
<item>And as for you ,you meant evil against me ,but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result ,to preserve many people alive. Genesis 50 20</item>
<item>Chance is the providence of adventurers.</item>
<item>It is our relation to circumstances that determine their influence over us. The same wind that blows one ship into port may blow another off shore.</item>
<item>You are where you are today because youve chosen to be there.</item>
<item>In practical life the wisest and soundest people avoid speculation.</item>
<item>We are no longer puppets being manipulated by outside powerful forces we become the powerful force ourselves.</item>
<item>Men are the sport of circumstances when it seems circumstances are the sport of men.</item>
<item>Do not let circumstances control you. You change your circumstances.</item>
<item>Chance can allow you to accomplish a goal every once in a while ,but consistent achievement happens only if you love what you are doing.</item>
<item>How things look on the outside of us depends on how things are on the inside of us.</item>
<item>If youre proactive ,you dont have to wait for circumstances or other people to create perspective expanding experiences. You can consciously create your own.</item>
<item>A fool must now and then be right ,by chance.</item>
<item>Chance makes our parents ,but choice makes our friends.</item>
<item>Nobody owes anybody a living ,but everybody is entitled to a chance.</item>
<item>Circumstances are beyond human control ,but our conduct is in our own power.</item>
<item>Whether youre winning or losing ,it is important to always be yourself. You cant change because of the circumstances around you.</item>
<item>Chance does not speak essentially through words nor can it be seen in their convolution. It is the eruption of language ,its sudden appearance. Its not a night twinkle with stars ,an illuminated sleep ,nor a drowsy vigil. It is the very edge of consciousness.</item>
<item>Do not always prove yourself to be the one in the right. The right will appear. You need only give it a chance.</item>
<item>The pseudonym for God when He did not want to sign.</item>
<item>Chance is the pseudonym God uses when He does not want to sign His name.</item>
<item>A wise man turns chance into good fortune.</item>
<item>Never swap horses crossing a stream.</item>
<item>Dont change horses while crossing a stream.</item>
<item>To change and change for the better are two different things</item>
<item>Change yourself ,change your fortunes.</item>
<item>A wise man changes his mind ,a fool never will.</item>
<item>Change means movement. Movement means friction. Only in the frictionless vacuum of a nonexistent abstract world can movement or change occur without that abrasive friction of conflict.</item>
<item>Who we are never changes. Who we think we are does.</item>
<item>Thats the risk you take if you change that people youve been involved with wont like the new you. But other people who do will come along.</item>
<item>So long as a person is capable of self renewal they are a living being.</item>
<item>The need for change bulldozed road down the center of my mind.</item>
<item>If you dont like something ,change it. If you cant change it ,change your attitude. Dont complain.</item>
<item>It is change ,continuing change ,inevitable change ,that is the dominant factor in society today. No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is ,but the world as it will be. This ,in turn ,means that our statesmen ,our businessmen ,our every man must take on a science fictional way of thinking.</item>
<item>The main dangers in this life are the people who want to change everything or nothing.</item>
<item>Observe constantly that all things take place by change ,and accustom thyself to consider that the nature of the Universe loves nothing so much as to change the things which are ,and to make new things like them.</item>
<item>That things are changed ,and that nothing really perishes ,and that the sum of matter remains exactly the same ,is sufficiently certain.</item>
<item>Everybody wants to do something to help ,but nobody wants to be the first.</item>
<item>Most of us are about as eager to be changed as we were to be born ,and go through our changes in a similar state of shock.</item>
<item>Not everything that is faced can be changed ,but nothing can be changed until it is faced.</item>
<item>People can cry much easier than they can change.</item>
<item>The most useless are those who never change through the years.</item>
<item>When youre through changing ,youre through.</item>
<item>The things that have come into being change continually. The man with a good memory remembers nothing because he forgets nothing.</item>
<item>The great person is ahead of their time ,the smart make something out of it ,and the blockhead ,sets themselves against it.</item>
<item>Change your life today. Dont gamble on the future ,act now ,without delay.</item>
<item>Wherever man goes to dwell his character goes with him.</item>
<item>If you stand straight ,do not fear a crooked shadow.</item>
<item>Clear conscience never fears midnight knocking.</item>
<item>Sow a thought and you reap an action sow an act and you reap a habit sow a habit and you reap a character sow a character and you reap a destiny.Among the many attributions found for this Ralph Waldo Emerson ,Andre Maurois ,Charles Reade ,Buddist Proverb ,Samuel Smiles ,James Allen ,George D. Boardman ,and Francis E. Willard</item>
<item>An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life A fight is going on inside me ,he said to the boy. It is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves. One is evil he is anger ,envy ,sorrow ,regret ,greed ,arrogance ,self pity ,guilt ,resentment ,inferiority ,lies ,false pride ,superiority ,and ego. The other is good he is joy ,peace ,love ,hope ,serenity ,humility ,kindness ,benevolence ,empathy ,generosity ,truth ,compassion ,and faith. This same fight is going on inside you and inside every other person ,too.The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather,Which wolf will win?The old Cherokee simply replied ,The one you feed.</item>

<item>One can easily judge the character of a person by the way they treat people who can do nothing for them.</item>
<item>Some people are born hammers ,others anvils.</item>
<item>A rich man has no need of character.</item>
<item>The highest qualities of character must be earned.</item>
<item>the highest qualities of character must be earned.</item>
<item>Guard against the prestige of great names see that your judgments are your own and do not shrink from disagreement no trusting without testing.</item>
<item>Character is the salesperson</item>
<item>It is in the character of very few men to honor without envy a friend who has prospered.</item>
<item>Honor is the inner garment of the Soul the first thing put on by it with the flesh ,and the last it layeth down at its separation from it.</item>
<item>Be thou incapable of change in that which is right ,and men will rely upon thee. Establish unto thyself principles of action and see that thou ever act according to them. First know that thy principles are just ,and then be thou</item>
<item>It is not what he had ,or even what he does which expresses the worth of a man ,but what he is.</item>
<item>Temperance is simply a disposition of the mind which binds the passion.</item>
<item>Character is that which reveals moral purpose ,exposing the class of things a man chooses or avoids.</item>
<item>Dignity does not consist in possessing honors ,but in deserving them.</item>
<item>My father told me that if you saw a man in a Rolls Royce you could be sure he was not a gentleman unless he was the chauffeur.</item>
<item>The hardest job kids face today is learning good manners without seeing any.</item>
<item>If you dont run your own life ,somebody else will.</item>
<item>Perfection of character consists in this living each day as if it were the last ,and spending each moment in peace.</item>
<item>When about to commit a base deed ,respect thyself ,though there is no witness.</item>
<item>Of what does not concern you say nothing good or bad.</item>
<item>From listening comes wisdom and from speaking ,repentance.</item>
<item>You people are telling me what you think I want to know. I want to know what is actually happening.</item>
<item>For parlor use ,the vague generality is a life saver.</item>
<item>Pure truth cannot be assimilated by the crowd it must be communicated by contagion.</item>
<item>It is not so much the content of what one says as the way in which one says it. However important the thing you say ,whats the good of it if not heard or ,being heard ,not felt.</item>
<item>God ,the illogic! The impossibility of communication in this house. The sheer operation alone of getting something through to somebody.</item>
<item>It pays to be obvious ,especially if you have a reputation for subtlety.</item>
<item>The worst thing about the miracle of modern communications is the Pavlovian pressure it places upon everyone to communicate whenever a bell rings.</item>
<item>The marriage of reason and nightmare which has dominated the 20th century has given birth to an ever more ambiguous world. Across the communications landscape move the specters of sinister technologies and the dreams that money can buy.</item>
<item>Ive not got a first in philosophy without being able to muddy things pretty satisfactory.</item>
<item>The ability to express an idea is well nigh as important as the idea itself.</item>
<item>Ordinary people who know nothing of phonetics or elocution have difficulties in understanding slow speech composed of perfect sounds ,while they have no difficulty in comprehending an imperfect gabble if only the accent and rhythm are natural.</item>
<item>Drawing on my fine command of the English language ,I said nothing.</item>
<item>You will get good attention and people will be more inclined to listen to you if you can make a statement whereby their response is ,No Shit! or at least ,No kidding!</item>
<item>It seemed rather incongruous that in a society of supersophisticated communication ,we often suffer from a shortage of listeners.</item>
<item>Self expression must pass into communication for its fulfillment.</item>
<item>For good or ill ,your conversation is your advertisement. Every time you open your mouth you let men look into your mind. Do they see it well clothed ,neat ,businesswise?</item>
<item>That must be wonderful I have no idea of what it means.</item>
<item>There are four ways ,and only four ways ,in which we have contact with the world. We are evaluated and classified by these four contacts what we do ,how we look ,what we say ,and how we say it.</item>
<item>The royal road to a mans heart is to talk to him about the things he treasures most.</item>
<item>Do but take care to express yourself in a plain ,easy Manner ,in well chosen ,significant and decent Terms ,and to give a harmonious and pleasing Turn to your Periods study to explain your Thoughts ,and set them in the truest Light ,labouring as much as possible ,not to leave them dark nor intricate ,but clear and intelligible.</item>
<item>If you cry Forward you must be sure to make clear the direction in which to go. Dont you see that if you fail to do that and simply call out the word to a monk and a revolutionary ,they will go in precisely opposite directions?</item>
<item>No comment is a splendid expression. I am using it again and again.</item>
<item>I have never accepted what many people have kindly said namely that I inspired the nation. Their will was resolute and remorseless ,and as it proved ,unconquerable. It fell to me to express it.</item>
<item>What goes up must come down. Ask any system administrator.</item>
<item>Whos General Failure and whys he reading my disk?</item>
<item>The Next Computer The hardware makes it a PC ,the software makes it a workstation ,the unit sales makes it a mainframe.</item>
<item>Whom computers would destroy ,they must first drive mad.</item>
<item>If you cant beat your computer at chess ,try kickboxing.</item>
<item>Intel has announced its next chip the Repentium.</item>
<item>Pentiums melt in your PC ,not in your hand.</item>
<item>All programmers are playwrights and all computers are lousy actors.</item>
<item>Want to make your computer go really fast? Throw it out a window.</item>
<item>If a trainstation is where the train stops ,whats a workstation ?</item>
<item>Where the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons ,computers in the future may have only 1,000 vacuum tubes and weigh only 1 1/2 tons.</item>
<item>At the dictation of a mathematician ,it will solve in a matter of hours equations never before solved because of their intricacy and the enormous time and personnel which would be required to work them out on ordinary office calculators.</item>
<item>The idea that Bill Gates has appeared like a knight in shining armor to lead all customers out of a mire of technological chaos neatly ignores the fact that it was he who ,by peddling second rate technology ,led them into it in the first place.</item>
<item>At the present time there exist problems beyond our ability to solve ,not because of theoretical difficulties ,but because of insufficient means of mechanical computation.</item>
<item>The desire to economize time and mental effort in arithmetical computations ,and to eliminate human liability to error is probably as old as the science of arithmetic itself.</item>
<item>Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that ,once it is competently programmed and working smoothly ,it is completely honest.</item>
<item>I do not fear computers. I fear lack of them.</item>
<item>One of the most feared expressions in modern times is The computer is down</item>
<item>Electronic aids ,particularly domestic computers ,will help the inner migration ,the opting out of reality. Reality is no longer going to be the stuff out there ,but the stuff inside your head. Its going to be commercial and nasty at the same time.</item>
<item>I am not the only person who uses his computer mainly for the purpose of diddling with his computer.</item>
<item>The word user is the word used by the computer professional when they mean idiot.</item>
<item>The sad thing about artificial intelligence is that it lacks artifice and therefore intelligence.</item>
<item>Computer science only indicates the retrospective omnipotence of our technologies. In other words ,an infinite capacity to process data but only data i.e. the already given and in no sense a new vision. With that science ,we are entering an era of exhaustivity ,which is also an era of exhaustion.</item>
<item>The most likely way for the world to be destroyed ,most experts agree ,is by accident. Thats where we come in were computer professionals. We cause accidents.</item>
<item>Silicon Valley is like a person running around in front of a steamroller. You can outrun the steamroller on any given day. But if you ever sit down you get squashed.</item>
<item>I will master something ,then the creativity will come.</item>
<item>If you</item>
<item> Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep.</item>
<item>The thing that makes a creative person is to be creative and that is all there is to it.</item>
<item>Whatever creativity is ,it is in part a solution to a problem.</item>
<item>Had I been present at the creation of the world I would have proposed some improvements.</item>
<item>The creative person wants to be a know it all. He wants to know about all kinds of things ancient history ,nineteenth century mathematics ,current manufacturing techniques ,flower arranging ,and hog futures. Because he never knows when these ideas might come together to form a new idea. It may happen six minutes later or six months ,or six years down the road. But he has faith that it will happen.</item>
<item>No one has ever written ,painted ,sculpted ,modeled ,built ,or invented except literally to get out of hell.</item>
<item>The lash may force men to physical labor ,it cannot force them to spiritual creativity.</item>
<item>All works of art are commissioned in the sense that no artist can create one by a simple act of will but must wait until what he believes to be a good idea for a work comes to him.</item>
<item> Originality is the essence of true scholarship. Creativity is the soul of the true scholar.</item>
<item>An inventor is a man who looks upon the world and is not contented with things as they are. He wants to improve whatever he sees ,he wants to benefit the world.</item>
<item>Much ingenuity with a little money is vastly more profitable and amusing than much money without ingenuity.</item>
<item>There are two ways of being creative. One can sing and dance. Or one can create an environment in which singers and dancers flourish.</item>
<item>I must create a system or be enslaved by another man s I will not reason and compare my business is to create.</item>
<item>We are all cups ,constantly and quietly being filled. The trick is ,knowing how to tip ourselves over and let the beautiful stuff out.</item>
<item>Make visible what ,without you ,might perhaps never have been seen.</item>
<item>I set out to show that there exists single creative activity,which is displayed alike in the arts and in the sciences.It is wrong to think of science as a mechanical record of facts ,and it is wrong to think of the arts as remote and private fancies. What makes each human ,what makes them universal ,is the stamp of the creative mind.</item>
<item>The good ideas are all hammered out in agony by individuals ,not spewed out by groups.</item>
<item>Creativity comes from trust. Trust your instincts. And never hope more than you work.</item>
<item>The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this a human creature born abnormally ,inhumanly sensitive. To him ,a touch is a blow ,a sound is a noise ,a misfortune is a tragedy ,a joy is an ecstasy ,a friend is a lover ,a lover is a god ,and failure is death. Add to this cruelly delicate organism the overpowering necessity to create ,create ,create so that without the creating of music or poetry or books or buildings or something of meaning ,his very breath is cut off from him. He must create ,must pour out creation. By some strange ,unknown ,inward urgency he is not really alive unless he is creating.</item>
<item>The human mind cannot create anything. It produces nothing until after having been fertilized by experience and meditation its acquisitions are the gems of its production.</item>
<item>It is better to create than to learn! Creating is the essence of life.</item>
<item> A hunch is creativity trying to tell you something.</item>
<item>Those who create are rare those who cannot are numerous. Therefore ,the latter are stronger.</item>
<item>Dignity consists not in possessing honors ,but in the consciousness that we deserve them.</item>
<item>Dignity belongs to the conquered.</item>
<item>Every man has his dignity. Im willing to forget mine ,but at my own discretion and not when someone else tells me to.</item>
<item>At night ,when the curtains are drawn and the fire flickers ,my books attain a collective dignity.</item>
<item>The ultimate end of all revolutionary social change is to establish the sanctity of human life ,the dignity of man ,the right of every human being to liberty and well being.</item>
<item>Dignity is a mask we wear to hide our ignorance.</item>
<item>There is a healthful hardiness about real dignity that never dreads contact and communion with others however humble.</item>
<item>Only man has dignity only man ,therefore ,can be funny.</item>
<item>True dignity is never gained by place ,and never lost when honors are withdrawn.</item>
<item>Human rights rest on human dignity. The dignity of man is an ideal worth fighting for and worth dying for.</item>
<item>If a man happens to find himself ,he has a mansion which he can inhabit with dignity all the days of his life.</item>
<item>Each of us ,face to face with other men ,is clothed with some sort of dignity ,but we know only too well all the unspeakable things that go on in the heart.</item>
<item>Perhaps the only true dignity of man is his capacity to despise himself.</item>
<item>Our dignity is not in what we do ,but what we understand.</item>
<item>Human Dignity has gleamed only now and then and here and there ,in lonely splendor ,throughout the ages ,a hope of the better men ,never an achievement of the majority.</item>
<item>Never step over one duty to perform another.</item>
<item>Duty is heavy as a mountain but Death is lighter than a feather.</item>
<item>Rank imposes obligation.</item>
<item>The most beautiful things in the universe are the starry heavens above us and the feeling of duty within us.</item>
<item>The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire.</item>
<item>Care not for time and success. Act out thy part ,whether it be to fail or to prosper.</item>
<item>How do you know if your mission in life is finished? If youre still alive ,it isnt.</item>
<item>He who is false to present duty breaks a thread in the loom ,and will find the flaw when he may have forgotten its cause.</item>
<item>Duty. That which sternly impels us in the direction of profit ,along the line of desire.</item>
<item>Do the duty which lies nearest to you ,the second duty will then become clearer.</item>
<item>Our duty ,as men and women ,is to proceed as if limits to our ability did not exist. We are collaborators in creation.</item>
<item>When one has come to accept a certain course as duty he has a pleasant sense of relief and of lifted responsibility ,even if the course involves pain and renunciation. It is like obedience to some external authority any clear way ,though it lead to death ,is mentally preferable to the tangle of uncertainty.</item>
<item>The right thing to do never requires any subterfuge ,it is always simple and direct.</item>
<item>Do your duty and leave the rest to heaven.</item>
<item>Sufficient to each day are the duties to be done and the trials to be endured. God never built a Christian strong enough to carry todays duties and tomorrows anxieties piled on the top of them.</item>
<item>Duty cannot exist without faith.</item>
<item>The reward of ones duty is the power to fulfill another.</item>
<item>Do that which is assigned to you and you cannot hope too much or dare too much.</item>
<item>Oh! Duty is an icy shadow. It will freeze you. It cannot fill the hearts sanctuary.</item>
<item>Duty largely consists of pretending that the trivial is critical.</item>
<item>Can you have more than one major MISSION pervading your life? NO. That would be like coming to a fork in the road and trying to go both ways by straddling it.</item>
<item>I sighed as a lover ,I obeyed as a son.</item>
<item>Make your life a mission not an intermission.</item>
<item>How can we know ourselves? Never by reflection ,but only through action. Begin at once to do your duty and immediately you will know what is inside you.</item>
<item>Love can do much ,but duty more.</item>
<item>He who dies with the most toys is ,nonetheless ,still dead.</item>
<item>Be happy while youre living ,for youre a long time dead.</item>
<item>Death was afraid of him because he had the heart of a lion.</item>
<item>Life is a dream walking death is a going home.</item>
<item>Death is a shadow that always follows the body.</item>
<item>Death always comes too early or too late.</item>
<item>Our last garment is made without pockets.</item>
<item>Its astonishing how important a man becomes when he dies.</item>
<item>Once the game is over ,the king and the pawn go back in the same box.</item>
<item>Every man goes down to his death bearing in his hands only that which he has given away.</item>
<item>There is a remedy for everything it is called death.</item>
<item>Good men must die ,but death cannot kill their names.</item>
<item>We come and cry and that is life ,we cry and go and that is death.</item>
<item>If your time aint come not even a doctor can kill you.</item>
<item>The cemeteries are filled with people who thought the world couldnt get along without them.</item>
<item>The fear of death often proves mortal ,and sets people on methods to save their Lives ,which infallibly destroy them.</item>
<item>See in what peace a Christian can die.</item>
<item>Time is not what you think. Dying? Not the end of everything. We think it is. But what happens on earth is only the beginning.</item>
<item>Im not afraid to die ,I just dont want to be there when it happens.</item>
<item>On the plus side ,death is one of the few things that can be done just as easily as lying down.</item>
<item>I dont believe in an after life ,although I am bringing a change of underwear.</item>
<item>There are three kinds of death in this world. Theres heart death ,theres brain death ,and theres being off the network.</item>
<item>A dying man needs to die ,as a sleepy man needs to sleep ,and there comes a time when it is wrong ,as well as useless ,to resist.</item>
<item>A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.</item>
<item>Interior design is a travesty of the architectural process and a frightening condemnation of the credulity ,helplessness and gullibility of the most formidable consumers</item>
<item>Why kick the man downstream who cant put the parts together because the parts really werent designed properly?</item>
<item>Perhaps believing in good design is like believing in God ,it makes you an optimist.</item>
<item>Retail is detail.</item>
<item>Art has to move you and design does not ,unless its a good design for a bus.</item>
<item>Design is not just what it looks like. Design is how it works.</item>
<item>ARCHITECTURE , The art of how to waste space.</item>
<item>Design in art ,is a recognition of the relation between various things ,various elements in the creative flux. You cant invent a design. You recognize it ,in the fourth dimension. That is ,with your blood and your bones ,as well as with your eyes.</item>
<item>Design is not for philosophy its for life.</item>
<item>Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context a chair in a room ,a room in a house ,a house in an environment ,an environment in a city plan.</item>
<item>Architecture in general is frozen music.</item>
<item>Form follows function.</item>
<item>Less is more. see Browning</item>
<item>Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space.</item>
<item>In architecture as in all other operative arts ,the end must direct the operation. The end is to build well. Well building has three conditions Commodity ,Firmness and Delight.</item>
<item>The complaint about modern steel furniture ,modern glass houses ,modern red bars and modern streamlined trains and cars is that all these objets modernize ,while adequate and amusing in themselves ,tend to make the people who use them look dated. It is an honest criticism. The human race has done nothing much about changing its own appearance to conform to the form and texture of its appurtenances.</item>
<item>Noble life demands a noble architecture for noble uses of noble men. Lack of culture means what it has always meant ignoble civilization and therefore imminent downfall.</item>
<item>Designs in connection with postage stamps and coinage may be described ,I think ,as the silent ambassadors on national taste.</item>
<item>Glutton one who digs his grave with his teeth.</item>
<item>The most violent appetites in all creatures are lust and hunger the first is a perpetual call upon them to propagate their kind ,the latter to preserve themselves.</item>
<item>Outside every fat man there was an even fatter man trying to close in.</item>
<item>Changing our diet is something we choose to do ,not something we are forced to do. Instead of dreading it ,try saying ,Heres another thing I get to do to help myself. Great!</item>
<item>I dont weigh a pound over one hundred and eighty and ,whats more ,I never did.</item>
<item>The obese is in a total delirium. For he is not only large ,of a size opposed to normal morphology he is larger than large. He no longer makes sense in some distinctive opposition ,but in his excess ,his redundancy.</item>
<item>Probably nothing in the world arouses more false hopes Than the first four hours of a diet.</item>
<item>The miser and the glutton are two facetious buzzards one hides his store ,and the other stores his hide.</item>
<item>Every day the fat woman dies a series of small deaths.</item>
<item>I dont mind that Im fat. You still get the same money.</item>
<item>Their kitchen is their shrine ,the cook their priest ,the table their altar ,and their belly their god.</item>
<item>Imprisoned in every fat man ,a thin one is wildly signaling to be let out.</item>
<item>Tis a superstition to insist on a special diet. All is made at last of the same chemical atoms.</item>
<item>One meal a day is enough for a lion ,and it ought to be for a man.</item>
<item>In general ,mankind ,since the improvement of cookery ,eats twice as much as nature requires.</item>
<item>I have always wanted a mistress who was fat ,and I have never found one. To make a fool of me ,they are always pregnant.</item>
<item>its a sex object if youre pretty and no love or love and no sex if youre fat</item>
<item>Thin people are beautiful ,but fat people are adorable.</item>
<item>A poor man who eats too much ,as contradistinguished from a gourmand ,who is a rich man who lives well.</item>
<item>Who ever hears of fat men heading a riot ,or herding together in turbulent mobs? No no ,your lean ,hungry men who are continually worrying society ,and setting the whole community by the ears.</item>
<item>When the stomach is full ,it is easy to talk of fasting.</item>
<item>They whose sole bliss is eating can give but that one brutish reason why they live.</item>
<item>Appetite is essentially insatiable ,and where it operates as a criterion of both action and enjoyment that is ,everywhere in the Western world since the sixteenth century it will infallibly discover congenial agencies mechanical and political of expression.</item>
<item>Some people are born to fatness. Others have to get there.</item>
<item>How easy for those who do not bulge to not overindulge!</item>
<item>I dreamed a thousand new paths. I woke and walked my old one.</item>
<item>If you want your dreams to come true ,dont over sleep.</item>
<item>If you have only two pennies left in the world ,with the first penny ,you should buy rice to feed your family. With the second penny ,say the wise Japanese ,you should buy a lily. The Japanese understand the importance of dreaming </item>
<item>When one of your dreams come true ,you begin to look at the others more carefully.</item>
<item>He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it.</item>
<item>Our dreams drench us in senses ,and senses steps us again in dreams.</item>
<item>He dreamed he was eating shredded wheat and woke up to find the mattress half gone.</item>
<item>The vision that you glorify in your mind ,the ideal that you enthrone in your heart this you will build your life by ,and this you will become.</item>
<item>Dream lofty dreams ,and as you dream ,so you shall become. Your vision is the promise of what you shall one day be your ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil.</item>
<item>The greatest achievements were at first and for a time dreams. The oak sleeps in the acorn.</item>
<item>What if nothing exists and were all in somebodys dream? Or whats worse ,what if only that fat guy in the third row exists?</item>
<item>I have heard it said that the first ingredient of success the earliest spark in the dreaming youth if this dream a great dream.</item>
<item>O reason ,reason ,abstract phantom of the waking state ,I had already expelled you from my dreams ,now I have reached a point where those dreams are about to become fused with apparent realities now there is only room here for myself.</item>

<item>A daydream is a meal at which images are eaten. Some of us are gourmets ,some gourmands ,and a good many take their images precooked out of a can and swallow them down whole ,absent mindedly and with little relish.</item>

<item>For in the end it is Middle Earth and its dwellers that we love ,not Tolkiens considerable gifts in showing it to us. I said once that the world he charts was there long before him ,and I still believe it. He is a great enough magician to tap our most common nightmares ,daydreams and twilight fancies ,but he never invented them either he found them a place to live ,a green alternative to each days madness here in a poisoned world. We are raised to honor all the wrong explorers and discoverers thieves planting flags ,murderers carrying crosses. Let us at last praise the colonizers of dreams.</item>

<item>America has been a land of dreams. A land where the aspirations of people from countries cluttered with rich ,cumbersome ,aristocratic ,ideological pasts can reach for what once seemed unattainable. Here they have tried to make dreams come true. Yet now  we are threatened by a new and particularly American menace. It is not the menace of class war ,of ideology ,of poverty ,of disease ,of illiteracy ,or demagoguery ,or of tyranny ,though these now plague most of the world. It is the menace of unreality.</item>

<item>They know enough who know how to learn.</item>
<item>There are two educations. One should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live.</item>
<item>Americas future will be determined by the home and the school. The child becomes largely what he is taught hence we must watch what we teach ,and how we live.</item>
<item>Education is a companion which no misfortune can depress ,no crime can destroy ,no enemy can alienate,no despotism can enslave. At home ,a friend ,abroad ,an introduction ,in solitude a solace and in society an ornament.It chastens vice ,it guides virtue ,it gives at once grace and government to genius. Without it ,what is man? A splendid slave ,a reasoning savage.</item>

<item>The race of prophets is extinct. Europe is becoming set in its ways ,slowly embalming itself beneath the wrappings of its borders ,its factories ,its law courts and its universities. The frozen Mind cracks between the mineral staves which close upon it. The fault lies with your moldy systems ,your logic of 2 + 2 = 4. The fault lies with you ,Chancellors ,caught in the net of syllogisms. You manufacture engineers ,magistrates ,doctors ,who know nothing of the true mysteries of the body or the cosmic laws of existence. False scholars blind outside this world ,philosophers who pretend to reconstruct the mind. The least act of spontaneous creation is a more complex and revealing world than any metaphysics.</item>
<item>Essentialists hope that when students leave school ,they will possess not only basic skills and an extensive body of knowledge ,but also disciplined ,practical minds ,capable of applying schoolhouse lessons in the real world.</item>
<item>The paradox of education is precisely this that as one begins to become conscious one begins to examine the society in which he is being educated.</item>
<item>It is very nearly impossible  to become an educated person in a country so distrustful of the independent mind.</item>
<item>A child cannot be taught by anyone who despises him ,and a child cannot afford to be fooled.</item>
<item>Education is the knowledge of how to use the whole of oneself. Many men use but one or two faculties out of the score with which they are endowed. A man is educated who knows how to make a tool of every faculty how to open it ,how to keep it sharp ,and how to apply it to all practical purposes.</item>
<item>A man is not rightly conditioned until he is a happy ,healthy ,and prosperous being and happiness ,health ,and prosperity are the result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer of the man with his surroundings.</item>
<item>The first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself.</item>
<item>People blame their environment. There is only one person to blame and only one themselves.</item>
<item>Man shapes himself through decision that shape his environment.</item>
<item>Every man is like the company he is wont to keep.</item>
<item>When we become a part of anything ,it becomes a part of us.</item>
<item>We are on the precipice of climate system tipping points beyond which there is no redemption.</item>
<item>We begin to see ,therefore ,the importance of selecting our environment with the greatest of care ,because environment is the mental feeding ground out of which the food that goes into our minds is extracted.</item>
<item>A person is either the effect of his environment or is able to have an effect upon his environment.</item>
<item>A strong ,successful man is not the victim of his environment. He creates favorable conditions. His own inherent force and energy compel things to turn out as he desires.</item>
<item>Every experience in life ,everything with which we have come in contact in life ,is a chisel which has been cutting away at our life statue ,molding ,modifying ,shaping it. We are part of all we have met. Everything we have seen ,heard ,felt or thought has had its hand in molding us ,shaping us.</item>
<item>We make the world we live in and shape our own environment.</item>
<item>Your outlook upon life ,your estimate of yourself ,your estimate of your value are largely colored by your environment. Your whole career will be modified ,shaped ,molded by your surroundings ,by the character of the people with whom you come in contact every day </item>
<item>Our environment ,the world in which we live and work ,is a mirror of our attitudes and expectations.</item>
<item>We are the environment.</item>
<item>We live in a web of ideas ,a fabric of our own making.</item>
<item>We are shaped by each other. We adjust not to the reality of a world ,but to the reality of other thinkers.</item>
<item>We found that the most exciting environments ,that treated people very well ,are also tough as nails. There is no bureaucratic mumbo jumbo  excellent companies provide two things simultaneously tough environments and very supportive environments.</item>
<item>It isnt pollution thats harming the environment. Its the impurities in our air and water that are doing it.</item>
<item>You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success or are they holding you back?</item>

<item>The true republic</item>
<item>By nature all men are equal in liberty ,but not in other endowments.</item>
<item>The beginning of reform is not so much to equalize property as to train the noble sort of natures not to desire more ,and to prevent the lower from getting more.</item>
<item>Equality consists in the same treatment of similar persons.</item>
<item>The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal.</item>
<item>When Adam delved and Eve span ,who was then the gentleman?</item>
<item>Equality may perhaps be a right ,but no power on earth can ever turn it into a fact.</item>
<item>The most mediocre of males feels himself a demigod as compared with women.</item>
<item>Weve got a generation now who were born with semi equality. They dont know how it was before ,so they think ,this isnt too bad. Were working. We have our attache cases and our three piece suits. I get very disgusted with the younger generation of women. We had a torch to pass ,and they are just sitting there. They dont realize it can be taken away. Things are going to have to get worse before they join in fighting the battle.</item>
<item>There has to be positive action that allows the most disadvantaged people to get their fair share of job opportunities.</item>
<item>We accept and welcome  as conditions to which we must accommodate ourselves ,great inequality of environment the concentration of business ,industrial and commercial ,in the hands of a few and the law of competition between these ,as being not only beneficial ,but essential for the future progress of the race.</item>

<item>Experience is a comb which nature gives to men when they are bald.</item>
<item>A burnt child dreads the fire.</item>
<item>I know by my own pot how the others boil.</item>
<item>He who has been bitten by a snake fears a piece of string.</item>
<item>Every creator painfully experiences the chasm between his inner vision and its ultimate expression.</item>
<item>Experience is a good teacher ,but she sends in terrific bills.</item>
<item>Experience is a private ,and a very largely speechless affair.</item>
<item>Experience that destroys innocents also leads one back to it.</item>
<item>You should make a point of trying every experience once ,excepting incest and folk dancing.</item>
<item>Our days are a kaleidoscope. Every instant a change takes place in the contents. New harmonies ,new contrasts ,new combinations of every sort. Nothing ever happens twice alike. The most familiar people stand each moment in some new relation to each other ,to their work ,to surrounding objects. The most tranquil house ,with the most serene inhabitants ,living upon the utmost regularity of system ,is yet exemplifying infinite diversities.</item>
<item>Experience is determined by yourself not the circumstances of your life.</item>
<item>Only he who can view his own past as an abortion sprung from compulsion and need can use it to full advantage in the present. For what one has lived is at best comparable to a beautiful statue which has had all its limbs knocked off in transit ,and now yields nothing but the precious block out of which the image of ones future must be hewn.</item>
<item>Bad experience is a school that only fools keep going to.</item>
<item>Experience is a revelation in the light of which we renounce our errors of youth for those of age.</item>
<item>Experience. The wisdom that enables us to recognize in an undesirable old acquaintance the folly that we have already embraced.</item>
<item>Experience is a school where a man learns what a big fool he has been.</item>
<item>Experience increases our wisdom but doesnt reduce our follies.</item>
<item>There is nothing so easy to learn as experience and nothing so hard to apply.</item>
<item>Few people even scratch the surface ,much less exhaust the contemplation of their own experience.</item>
<item>Experience isnt interesting until it begins to repeat itself. In fact ,till it does that ,it hardly is experience.</item>
<item>Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Governments purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal well meaning but without understanding.</item>
<item>Experience ,like a pale musician ,holds a dulcimer of patience in his hand.</item>
<item>I do not accept any absolute formulas for living. No preconceived code can see ahead to everything that can happen in a mans life. As we live ,we grow and our beliefs change. They must change. So I think we should live with this constant discovery. We should be open to this adventure in heightened awareness of living. We should stake our whole existence on our willingness to explore and experience.</item>
<item>I reached in experience the nirvana which is unborn ,unrivalled ,secure from attachment ,undecaying and unstained. This condition is indeed reached by me which is deep ,difficult to see ,difficult to understand ,tranquil ,excellent ,beyond the reach of mere logic ,subtle ,and to be realized only by the wise.</item>
<item>Do not look where you fell ,but where you slipped.</item>
<item>Everyone pushes a falling fence.</item>
<item>The great question is not whether you have failed ,but whether you are content with failure.</item>

<item>I have always felt that although someone may defeat me ,and I strike out in a ball game ,the pitcher on the particular day was the best player. But I know when I see him again ,Im going to be ready for his curve ball. Failure is a part of success. There is no such thing as a bed of roses all your life. But failure will never stand in the way of success if you learn from it.</item>
<item>The typical human life seems to be quite unplanned ,undirected ,unlived ,and unsavored. Only those who consciously think about the adventure of living as a matter of making choices among options ,which they have found for themselves ,ever establish real self control and live their lives fully.</item>
<item>They fail ,and they alone ,who have not striven.</item>
<item>There are few things more dreadful than dealing with a man who knows he is going under ,in his own eyes ,and in the eyes of others. Nothing can help that man. What is left of that man flees from what is left of human attention.</item>
<item>We are all failures at least ,all the best of us are.</item>
<item>If you dont stand for something ,youll fall for anything.</item>
<item>We pay just as dearly for our triumphs as we do for our defeats. Go ahead and fail. But fail with wit ,fail with grace ,fail with style. A mediocre failure is as insufferable as a mediocre success. Embrace failure! Seek it out. Learn to love it. That may be the only way any of us will ever be free. Tom Robbins Before you give up hope ,turn back and read the attacks that were made on Lincoln.</item>
<item>I wasnt afraid to fail. Something good always comes out of failure.</item>
<item>Its best to have failure happen early in life. It wakes up the Phoenix bird in you so you rise from the ashes.</item>
<item>Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.</item>
<item>On this path effort never goes to waste ,and there is no failure. Even a little effort toward spiritual awareness will protect you from the greatest fear.</item>
<item>A failure will not appear until a unit has passed final inspection.</item>
<item>My downfall raises me to infinite heights.</item>
<item>No one ever won a chess game by betting on each move. Sometimes you have to move backward to get a step forward.</item>
<item>Nothing fails like success because we dont learn from it. We learn only from failure.</item>
<item>A failure establishes only this ,that our determination to succeed was not strong enough.</item>
<item>To win youve got to stay in the game.</item>
<item>You must think of failure and defeat as the springboards to new achievements or to the next level of accomplishment.</item>
<item>Failure is an event ,never a person.</item>
<item>The mark of your ignorance is the depth of your belief in injustice and tragedy. What the caterpillar calls the end of the world ,the master calls a butterfly.</item>
<item>Weave in faith and God will find the thread.</item>
<item>A person consists of his faith. Whatever is his faith ,even so is he.</item>
<item>Faith is a continuation of reason.</item>
<item>In faith and hope the world will disagree ,But all mankinds concern is charity.</item>
<item>Where faith is there is courage ,there is fortitude ,there is steadfastness and strength  Faith bestows that sublime courage that rises superior to the troubles and disappointments of life ,that acknowledges no defeat except as a step to victory that is strong to endure ,patient to wait ,and energetic to struggle  Light up ,then ,the lamp of faith in your heart  It will lead you safely through the mists of doubt and the black darkness of despair along the narrow ,thorny ways of sickness and sorrow ,and over the treacherous places of temptation and uncertainty.</item>
<item>Faith has to do with things that are not seen ,and hope with things that are not in hand.</item>
<item>If we become completely whole hearted we will have love for all people and will seek in each person what is most holy ,what God has inspired in him or her. And only then will there be no danger of softening or twisting our witness. Why? Because the capacity of our faith will no longer be narrow. If we are not broadhearted ,we have not yet grasped the meaning of faith. We must always be ready to be newly led in our faith ,even through the tiniest atom of godliness we find in others. It is that which leads us to the kingdom of God. We affirm that there is something of God in all people something of the light. It may only gleam now ,but it will eventually lead to complete illumination.</item>
<item>May it not be that ,just as we have to have faith in Him ,God has to have faith in us and ,considering the history of the human race so far ,may it not be that faith is even more difficult for Him than it is for us?</item>
<item>In order to be a realist you must believe in miracles.</item>
<item>Faith is a higher faculty than reason.</item>
<item>You dont decide to build a church because you have money in the bank. You build because God says this is what I should do. Faith is the supplier of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.</item>
<item>The ablest men in all walks of modern life are men of faith. Most of them have much more faith than they themselves realize.</item>
<item>Faith without works is like a bird without wings though she may hop with her companions on earth ,yet she will never fly with them to heaven.</item>
<item>Our faith in the present dies out long before our faith in the future.</item>
<item>Faith is not a thing which one loses ,we merely cease to shape our lives by it.</item>
<item>I believe though I do not comprehend ,and I hold by faith what I cannot grasp with the mind.</item>
<item>Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for ,the conviction of things not seen. Hebrews 11 1</item>
<item>All things are possible to him who believes. Mark 9 23</item>
<item>According to your faith be it done unto you.</item>
<item>And without faith it is impossible to please him ,for he who comes to God must believe that he is ,and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him. Hebrews 11 6</item>
<item>If thou canst believe ,all things are possible to him that believeth. Mark 9 23</item>
<item>For verily I say unto you ,that whosoever shall say unto this mountain ,Be thou removed ,and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart ,but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith.</item>
<item>Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you. Peter 3 15</item>

<item>Look for the good ,not the evil ,in the conduct of members of the family.</item>
<item>One of lifes greatest mysteries is how the boy who wasnt good enough to marry your daughter can be the father of the smartest grandchild in the world.</item>
<item>When a father gives to his son ,both laugh when a son gives to his father ,both cry.</item>
<item>A friend who is near and dear may in time become as useless as a relative.</item>
<item>The family is the school of duties  founded on love.</item>
<item>A farmer who had a quarrelsome family called his sons and told them to lay a bunch of sticks before him. Then ,after laying the sticks parallel to one another and binding them ,he challenged his sons ,one after one ,to pick up the bundle and break it. They all tried ,but in vain. Then ,untying the bundle ,he gave them the sticks to break one by one. This they did with the greatest ease. Then said the father ,Thus ,my sons ,as long as you remain united ,you are a match for anything ,but differ and separate ,and you are undone.</item>
<item>Our notion of the perfect society embraces the family as its center and ornament ,and this paradise is not secure until children appear to animate and complete the picture.</item>
<item>Even as the cell is the unit of the organic body ,so the family is the unit of society.</item>
<item>Love ,by reason of its passion ,destroys the in between which relates us to and separates us from others. As long as its spell lasts ,the only in between which can insert itself between two lovers is the child ,loves own product. The child ,this in between to which the lovers now are related and which they hold in common ,is representative of the world in that it also separates them it is an indication that they will insert a new world into the existing world. Through the child ,it is as though the lovers return to the world from which their love had expelled them. But this new worldliness ,the possible result and the only possibly happy ending of a love affair ,is ,in a sense ,the end of love ,which must either overcome the partners anew or be transformed into another mode of belonging together.</item>
<item>Cruel is the strife of brothers.</item>
<item>Rarely do members of the same family grow up under the same roof.</item>
<item>He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune for they are impediments to great enterprises ,either of virtue or mischief.</item>
<item>You leave home to seek your fortune and ,when you get it ,you go home and share it with your family.</item>
<item>The babe at first feeds upon the mothers bosom ,but it is always on her heart.</item>
<item>There is no friendship ,no love ,like that of the parent for the child.</item>

<item>You hear a lot of dialogue on the death of the American family. Families arent dying. Theyre merging into big conglomerates.</item>
<item>A father is a banker provided by nature.</item>
<item>Certain is it that there is no kind of affection so purely angelic as of a father to a daughter. In love to our wives there is desire to our sons ,ambition but to our daughters there is something which there are no words to express.</item>
<item>That he delights in the misery of others no man will confess ,and yet what other motive can make a father cruel?</item>
<item>Sir Walter ,being strangely surprised and put out of his countenance at so great a table ,gives his son a damned blow over the face. His son ,as rude as he was ,would not strike his father ,but strikes over the face the gentleman that sat next to him and said Box about twill come to my father anon.</item>
<item>A father is always making his baby into a little woman. And when she is a woman he turns her back again.</item>
<item>If the relationship of father to son could really be reduced to biology ,the whole earth would blaze with the glory of fathers and sons.</item>
<item>Call no man your father upon the earth ,for one is your Father ,which is in heaven.</item>
<item>Fathers do not exasperate your children instead ,bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. Ephesians 6 4</item>
<item>When God was creating fathers ,He started with a tall frame. An angel nearby said ,What kind of father is that? If you</item>
<item>Those who have never had a father can at any rate never know the sweets of losing one. To most men the death of his father is a new lease of life.</item>
<item>As fathers commonly go ,it is seldom a misfortune to be fatherless and considering the general run of sons ,as seldom a misfortune to be childless.</item>
<item>Blessed indeed is the man who hears many gentle voices call him father!</item>
<item>The father who does not teach his son his duties is equally guilty with the son who neglects them.</item>
<item>Father knows exactly what those boys at the mall have in their depraved little minds because he once owned such a depraved little mind himself. In fact ,if he thinks enough about the plans that he used to have for young girls ,the father not only will support his wife in keeping their daughter home but he might even run over to the mall and have a few of those boys arrested.</item>
<item>If the new American father feels bewildered and even defeated ,let him take comfort from the fact that whatever he does in any fathering situation has a fifty percent chance of being right.</item>
<item>You know ,fathers just have a way of putting everything together.</item>
<item>Be kind to thy father ,for when thou were young ,who loved thee so fondly as he? He caught the first accents that fell from thy tongue ,and joined in thy innocent glee.</item>
<item>In peace the sons bury their fathers ,but in war the fathers bury their sons.</item>
<item>I watched a small man with thick calluses on both hands work fifteen and sixteen hours a day. I saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms of his feet ,a man who came here uneducated ,alone ,unable to speak the language ,who taught me all I needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example.</item>
<item>What a dreadful thing it must be to have a dull father.</item>
<item>I believe that what we become depends on what our fathers teach us at odd moments ,when they arent trying to teach us.</item>
<item>Noble fathers have noble children.</item>
<item>To a father growing old nothing is dearer than a daughter.</item>
<item>I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a fathers protection.</item>
<item>To be a successful father  theres one absolute rule when you have a kid ,dont look at it for the first two years.</item>

<item>According to legend ,one day a man was wandering in the desert when he met Fear and Plague. They said they were on their way to a large city where they were going to kill 10,000 people. The man asked Plague if he was going to do all the work. Plague smiled and said ,No ,Ill only take care of a few hundred. Ill let my friend Fear do the rest.</item>
<item>He who fears to suffer ,suffers from fear.</item>
<item>That fear may reach all ,punish but few.</item>
<item>A scalded cat dreads cold water.</item>
<item>People always make the wolf more formidable than he is.</item>
<item>Fear the man who fears you.</item>
<item>Fear only two God ,and the man who has no fear of God.</item>
<item>As the ostrich when pursued hideth his head ,but forgetteth his body so the fears of a coward expose him to danger.</item>
<item>People are only mean when theyre threatened ,and thats what our culture does. Thats what our economy does.</item>
<item>It is not a matter of being fearless. The fear is sometimes constant ,but its about moving forward regardless of the fear. Courage means feeling the fear and doing it anyway.</item>
<item>Fear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.</item>
<item>An ugly sight ,a man who is afraid.</item>
<item>Come to the edge ,He said. They said ,We are afraid. Come to the edge ,He said. They came. He pushed them  and they flew.</item>
<item>Every time you win ,it diminishes the fear a little bit. You never really cancel the fear of losing you keep challenging it.</item>
<item>It is not death that a man should fear ,but he should fear never beginning to live.</item>
<item>You mistake me ,my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.</item>
<item>Men fear death as children fear to go in the dark and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales ,so is the other.</item>
<item>It is a miserable state of mind to have few things to desire and many things to fear.</item>
<item>At mans core there is a voice that wants him never to give in to fear. But if it is true that in general man cannot give in to fear ,at the very least he postpones indefinitely the moment when he will have to confront himself with the object of his fear  when he will no longer have the assistance of reason as guaranteed by God ,or when he will no longer have the assistance of God such as reason guaranteed. It is necessary to recoil ,but it is necessary to leap ,and perhaps one only recoils in order to leap better.</item>
<item>Fear is not a good teacher. The lessons of fear are quickly forgotten.</item>
<item>Terror is as much a part of the concept of truth as runniness is of the concept of jam. We wouldnt like jam if it didnt ,by its very nature ,ooze. We wouldnt like truth if it wasnt sticky ,if ,from time to time ,it didnt ooze blood.</item>
<item>Fear secretes acids but love and trust are sweet juices.</item>
<item>Fear is met and destroyed with courage.</item>
<item>Tell us your phobias ,and we will tell you what you are afraid of.</item>
<item>He who eats alone chokes alone.</item>
<item>Dont dig your grave with your knife and fork.</item>
<item>Hunger is the best sauce.</item>
<item>Coffee should be black as Hell ,strong as death ,and sweet as love.</item>
<item>A good meal ought to begin with hunger.</item>
<item>Appetite comes with eating the more one has ,the more one would have.</item>
<item>He that eats till he is sick must fast till he is well.</item>
<item>The most dangerous food to eat is a wedding cake.</item>
<item>Sevens a banquet nine a brawl.</item>
<item>Much meat ,much disease.</item>
<item>Hunger is a good cook.</item>
<item>Gluttony kills more than the sword.</item>
<item>I will not eat oysters. I want my food dead not sick ,not wounded dead.</item>
<item>We live in an age when pizza gets to your home before the police.</item>
<item>The first law of dietetics seems to be if it tastes good ,its bad for you.</item>
<item>Talk of joy there may be things better than beef stew and baked potatoes and home made bread there may be.</item>
<item>I would like to find a stew that will give me heartburn immediately ,instead of at three o clock in the morning.</item>
<item>Public and private food in America has become eatable ,here and there extremely good. Only the fried potatoes go unchanged ,as deadly as before.</item>
<item>They eat the dainty food of famous chefs with the same pleasure with which they devour gross peasant dishes ,mostly composed of garlic and tomatoes ,or fishermans octopus and shrimps ,fried in heavily scented olive oil on a little deserted beach.</item>
<item>Sadder than destitution ,sadder than a beggar is the man who eats alone in public. Nothing more contradicts the laws of man or beast ,for animals always do each other the honor of sharing or disputing each others food.</item>
<item>A gourmet who thinks of calories is like a tart ,who looks at her watch.</item>
<item>Only the pure in heart can make a good soup.</item>
<item>Taking food alone tends to make one hard and coarse. Those accustomed to it must lead a Spartan life if they are not to go downhill. Hermits have observed ,if for only this reason ,a frugal diet. For it is only in company that eating is done justice food must be divided and distributed if it is to be well received.</item>
<item>Yogi ordered a pizza. The waitress asked How many pieces do you want your pie cut? Yogi responded ,Four. I dont think I could eat eight.</item>

<item>Repentance wont cure mischief.</item>
<item>Forgiveness is love in its most noble form.</item>
<item>Forgive and forget.</item>
<item>Never repeat old grievances.</item>
<item>A reconciled friend is a double enemy.</item>
<item>Those that do you a very ill deed will never forgive you.</item>
<item>If I die ,I forgive you. If I live we shall see.</item>
<item>Whoever approaches Me walking ,I will come to him running and he who meets Me with sins equivalent to the whole world ,I will greet him with forgiveness equal to it.</item>
<item>In contrast to revenge ,which is the natural ,automatic reaction to transgression and which ,because of the irreversibility of the action process can be expected and even calculated ,the act of forgiving can never be predicted it is the only reaction that acts in an unexpected way and thus retains ,though being a reaction ,something of the original character of action.</item>
<item>Bad men are full of repentance.</item>
<item>Forgive many things in others nothing in yourself.</item>
<item>They who forgive most shall be most forgiven.</item>
<item>The best thing to give to your enemy is forgiveness to an opponent ,tolerance to a friend ,your heart to your child ,a good example to a father ,deference to your mother ,conduct that will make her proud of you to yourself ,respect to all men ,charity.</item>
<item>I never forgive ,but I always forget.</item>
<item>Every man should keep a fair sized cemetery in which to bury the faults of his friends.</item>
<item>Giving The best thing to give to your enemy is forgiveness to an opponent ,tolerance to a friend ,your heart to your child ,a good example to a father ,deference to your mother ,conduct that will make her proud of you to yourself ,respect to all men.</item>
<item>God pardons like a mother ,who kisses the offense into everlasting forgiveness.</item>
<item>I can forgive ,but I cannot forget ,is only another way of saying ,I will not forgive. Forgiveness ought to be like a canceled note torn in two ,and burned up ,so that it never can be shown against one.</item>
<item>I can forgive ,but I cannot forget ,is only another way of saying ,I cannot forgive.</item>
<item>Repentance is another name for aspiration.</item>
<item>Compassion will cure more sins than condemnation.</item>
<item>My transgression is sealed up in a bag ,and thou sewest up mine iniquity. Job 14 17</item>
<item>In him we have redemption through his blood ,the forgiveness of our trespasses ,according to the riches of his grace. Ephesians 1 7</item>
<item>And be kind to one another ,tender hearted ,forgiving each other ,just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. Ephesians 4 32</item>
<item>To apologize is to lay the foundation for a future offense.</item>
<item>The saving man becomes the free man.</item>
<item>Liberty ,according to my metaphysics is a self determining power in an intellectual agent. It implies thought and choice and power.</item>
<item>Yesterday the greatest question was decided which ever was debated in America and a greater perhaps never was ,nor will be ,decided among men. A resolution was passed without one dissenting colony ,that these United Colonies are ,and of right ought to be ,free and independent States.</item>
<item>When people talk of the freedom of writing ,speaking or thinking I cannot choose but laugh. No such thing ever existed. No such thing now exists but I hope it will exist. But it must be hundreds of years after you and I shall write and speak no more.</item>
<item>Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.</item>
<item>If ye love wealth better than liberty ,the tranquillity of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom ,go home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains set lightly upon you ,and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen.</item>
<item>Freedom is the emancipation from the arbitrary rule of other men.</item>
<item>When we were told that by freedom we understood free enterprise ,we did very little to dispel this monstrous falsehood. Wealth and economic well being ,we have asserted ,are the fruits of freedom ,while we should have been the first to know that this kind of happiness has been an unmixed blessing only in this country ,and it is a minor blessing compared with the truly political freedoms ,such as freedom of speech and thought ,of assembly and association ,even under the best conditions.</item>
<item>Man cannot be free if he does not know that he is subject to necessity ,because his freedom is always won in his never wholly successful attempts to liberate himself from necessity.</item>
<item>Democracy arose from mens thinking that if they are equal in any respect ,they are equal absolutely.</item>
<item>Within yourself deliverance must be searched for ,because each man makes his own prison.</item>
<item>A nation which makes the final sacrifice for life and freedom does not get beaten.</item>
<item>The fly that touches honey cannot use its wings so too the soul that clings to spiritual sweetness ruins its freedom and hinders contemplation.</item>
<item>The most intellectual of men are moved quite as much by the circumstances which they are used to as by their own will. The active voluntary part of a man is very small ,and if it were not economized by a sleepy kind of habit ,its results would be null.</item>
<item>Any honest examination of the national life proves how far we are from the standard of human freedom with which we began. The recovery of this standard demands of everyone who loves this country a hard look at himself ,for the greatest achievements must begin somewhere ,and they always begin with the person. If we are not capable of this examination ,we may yet become one of the most distinguished and monumental failures in the history of nations.</item>
<item>The oppression of any people for opinions sake has rarely had any other effect than to fix those opinions deeper ,and render them more important.</item>
<item>Freedom all solace to man gives He lives at ease that freely lives.</item>
<item>What a curious phenomenon it is that you can get men to die for the liberty of the world who will not make the little sacrifice that is needed to free themselves from their own individual bondage.</item>
<item>The greatest blessing of our democracy is freedom. But in the last analysis ,our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves.</item>
<item>In the last analysis ,our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves.</item>
<item>The liberated man is not the one who is freed in his ideal reality ,his inner truth ,or his transparency he is the man who changes spaces ,who circulates ,who changes sex ,clothes ,and habits according to fashion ,rather than morality ,and who changes opinions not as his conscience dictates but in response to opinion polls.</item>
<item>As for freedom ,it will soon cease to exist in any shape or form. Living will depend upon absolute obedience to a strict set of arrangements ,which it will no longer be possible to transgress. The air traveler is not free. In the future ,lifes passengers will be even less so they will travel through their lives fastened to their corporate seats.</item>
<item>You need only reflect that one of the best ways to get yourself a reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is to go about repeating the very phrases which our founding fathers used in the struggle for independence.</item>
<item>True obedience is true freedom.</item>
<item>There are always risks in freedom. The only risk in bondage is breaking free.</item>
<item>The enemy of my enemy is my friend.</item>
<item>A friend is known when needed.</item>
<item>Do not tell a friend anything you would conceal from an enemy.</item>
<item>With true friends  even water drunk together is sweet enough.</item>
<item>No one is rich enough to do without a neighbor.</item>
<item>Your friendship is your needs answered.</item>
<item>You may poke a mans fire after youve known him for seven years.</item>
<item>Friends are like fiddle strings ,they must not be screwed too tight.</item>
<item>One who looks for a friend without faults will have none.</item>
<item>The good fellow to everyone is a good friend to no one.</item>
<item>A friend you have to buy enemies you get for nothing.</item>
<item>When I find myself fading ,I close my eyes and realize my friends are my energy.</item>
<item>The road to a friends house is never long.</item>
<item>There</item>
<item>Friendship is like a prism through which the many variations of beauty are revealed in our lives.</item>
<item>A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out.</item>
<item>A memory lasts forever. Never does it die.True friends stay together.And never say goodbye.</item>
<item>A man should choose a friend who is better than himself. There are plenty of acquaintances in the world but very few real friends.</item>
<item>To keep a new friend ,never break with the old.</item>
<item>Tell me whos your friend and Ill tell you who you are.</item>
<item>An ounce of blood is worth more than a pound of friendship.</item>
<item>Who seeks a faultless friend remains friendless.</item>
<item>Who ceases to be a friend never was one.</item>
<item>These can never be true friends Hope ,dice ,a prostitute ,a robber ,a cheat ,a goldsmith ,a monkey ,a doctor ,a distiller.</item>
<item>For the friendship of two ,the patience of one is required.</item>
<item>Those who foretell the future lies ,even if he tells the truth.</item>
<item>When men speak of the future ,the Gods laugh.</item>
<item>Tomorrow is often the busiest day of the week.</item>
<item>Tomorrow never comes.</item>
<item>The future comes one day at a time.</item>
<item>Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it ,if you have to ,with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.</item>
<item>The future is  black.</item>
<item>Pop artists deal with the lowly trivia of possessions and equipment that the present generation is lugging along with it on its safari into the future.</item>
<item>I would sum up my fear about the future in one word boring. And thats my one fear that everything has happened nothing exciting or new or interesting is ever going to happen again  the future is just going to be a vast ,conforming suburb of the soul.</item>
<item>Its tough to make predictions ,especially about the future.</item>
<item>I have a Vision of the Future ,chum. The workers flats in fields of soya beans tower up like silver pencils ,score on score.</item>
<item>Take no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Matthew 6 34</item>
<item>Future. That period of time in which our affairs prosper ,our friends are true and our happiness is assured.</item>
<item>All futurity seems teeming with endless destruction never to be repelled Desperate remorse swallows the present in a quenchless rage.</item>
<item>The future destiny of the child is always the work of the mother.</item>
<item>In answer to your inquiry ,I consider that the chief dangers which confront the coming century will be religion without the Holy Ghost ,Christianity without Christ ,forgiveness without repentance ,salvation without regeneration ,politics without God ,and heaven without hell.</item>
<item>When all else is lost ,the future still remains.</item>
<item>I dont try to describe the future. I try to prevent it.</item>
<item>Let</item>
<item>I look to the future because thats where Im going to spend the rest of my life.</item>
<item>The future is as bright as the promises of God.</item>
<item>By the street of by and by ,one arrives at the house of never.</item>
<item>Failure is unimportant. It takes courage to make a fool of yourself.</item>
<item>our day will come is another way of saying you get yours.</item>
<item>It is my belief that whereas the twentieth century has been a century of war and untold suffering ,the twenty first century should be one of peace and dialogue. As the continued advances in information technology make our world a truly global village ,I believe there will come a time when war and armed conflict will be considered an outdated and obsolete method of settling differences among nations and communities.</item>
<item>God will provide ah ,if only He would till He does!</item>
<item>If God lived on earth ,people would break his windows.</item>
<item>God is closest to those with broken hearts.</item>
<item>Forsake not God till you find a better master.</item>
<item>Every man for himself and God for us all.</item>
<item>What men usually ask for when they pray to God is ,that two and two may not make four.</item>
<item>Man does what he can ,God does what he will.</item>
<item>I find it interesting that the meanest life ,the poorest existence ,is attributed to Gods will ,but as human beings become more affluent ,as their living standard and style begin to ascend the material scale ,God descends the scale of responsibility at a commensurate speed.</item>
<item>With God ,what is terrible is that one never knows whether its not just a trick of the devil.</item>
<item>God is Love ,we are taught as children to believe. But when we first begin to get some inkling of how He loves us ,we are repelled it seems so cold ,indeed ,not love at all as we understand the word.</item>
<item>God brings men into deep waters not to drown them ,but to cleanse them.</item>
<item>They that deny a God destroy mans nobility for certainly man is of kin to the beasts by his body and ,if he be not of kin to God by his spirit ,he is a base and ignoble creature.</item>
<item>God hangs the greatest weights upon the smallest wires.</item>
<item>I went to the root of things ,and found nothing but Him alone.</item>
<item>We know all their gods they ignore ours. What they call our sins are our gods ,and what they call their gods ,we name otherwise.</item>
<item>To place oneself in the position of God is painful being God is equivalent to being tortured. For being God means that one is in harmony with all that is ,including the worst. The existence of the worst evils is unimaginable unless God willed them.</item>
<item>How can one better magnify the Almighty than by sniggering with him at his little jokes ,particularly the poorer ones.</item>
<item>The bastard! He doesnt exist!</item>
<item>Gods providence is on the side of clear heads.</item>
<item>And now Israel ,what does the Lord your God require from you ,but to fear the Lord your God ,to walk in all His ways and love Him ,and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul. Deuteronomy 10 12</item>
<item>But from there you will seek the Lord you God and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul. Deuteronomy 4 29</item>
<item>For now we see through a glass darkly ,but then face to face now I know in part ,but then shall I know even as also I am known. I Corinthians</item>
<item>God is not a man ,that he should lie ,nor a son of man ,that he should repent has he not said ,and will he not do it? Or has he spoken ,and will he not make it good? Numbers 23 19</item>
<item>Oh the depth of both the wisdom and riches of God! How unsearchable are his judgments ,and his ways beyond understanding.</item>
<item>A god who let us prove his existence would be an idol.</item>
<item>In the councils of a state ,the question is not so much ,what ought to be done? As ,what can be done?</item>
<item>Office without pay makes thieves.</item>
<item>You see ,you all start with the premise that democracy is some good. I dont think its worth a damn. I think Churchill is right ,the only thing to be said for democracy is that there is nothing else thats any better ,and therefore he used to say ,Tyranny tempered by assassination ,but lots of assassination. People say ,If the Congress were more representative of the people it would be better. I say the Congress is too damn representative. Its just as stupid as the people are just as uneducated ,just as dumb ,just as selfish. You know the Congress is a perfect example ,and created to be a perfect example.</item>
<item>Controversial proposals ,once accepted ,soon become hallowed.</item>
<item>Fear is the foundation of most government.</item>
<item>A government ,for protecting business only ,is but a carcass ,and soon falls by its own corruption and decay.</item>
<item>Our Congress is the finest body of men money can buy.</item>
<item>It is often said that men are ruled by their imaginations but it would be truer to say they are governed by the weakness of their imaginations.</item>
<item>Being nice to governments doesnt work ,they are such lying bastards.</item>
<item>Bureaucracy is a giant mechanism operated by pygmies.</item>
<item>Government is the great fiction ,through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.</item>
<item>We all have the republican spirit in our veins ,like syphilis in our bones. We are democratized and venerealized.</item>
<item>Governing today means giving acceptable signs of credibility. It is like advertising and it is the same effect that is achieved commitment to a scenario.</item>
<item>Beaverbrook is so pleased to be in the government that he is like the town tart who finally married the Mayor.</item>
<item>The worst thing in the world next to anarchy ,is government.</item>
<item>A Republican by principle and devotion ,I will ,until my death ,oppose all Royalists and all enemies of my Government and the Republic.</item>
<item>The object of government in peace and in war is not the glory of rulers or of races ,but the happiness of the common man.</item>
<item>Laws are like sausages ,it is better not to see them being made.</item>
<item>A government must not waiver once it has chosen its course. It must not look to the left or right but go forward.</item>
<item>The art of government is not to let me grow stale.</item>
<item>Public instruction should be the first object of government.</item>
<item>Large legislative bodies resolve themselves into coteries ,and coteries into jealousies.</item>
<item>The government must always be a step ahead of the popular movement.</item>
<item>Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants electric light the most efficient policeman.</item>
<item>But their determination to banish fools foundered ultimately in the installation of absolute idiots.</item>
<item> If you cannot be grateful for what you have received ,then be thankful for what you have been spared.</item>
<item>We count our miseries carefully ,and accept our blessings without much thought.</item>
<item>I would thank you from the bottom of my heart ,but for you my heart has no bottom.</item>
<item>I had the blues because I had no shoes until upon the street ,I met a man who had no feet.</item>
<item>Gratitude is the hearts memory.</item>
<item>Nothing more detestable does the earth produce than an ungrateful man.</item>
<item>Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough ,and more. It turns denial into acceptance ,chaos to order ,confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast ,a house into a home ,a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past ,brings peace for today ,and creates a vision for tomorrow.</item>
<item> Remember Gods bounty in the year. String the pearls of His favor. Hide the dark parts ,except so far as they are breaking out in light! Give this one day to thanks ,to joy ,to gratitude!</item>
<item>A proud man is seldom a grateful man ,for he never thinks he gets as much as he deserves.</item>
<item>Next to ingratitude the most painful thing to bear is gratitude.</item>
<item>Gratitude is the fairest blossom which springs from the soul.</item>
<item>Sometimes we need to remind ourselves that thankfulness is indeed a virtue.</item>
<item>Whatever I am offered in devotion with a pure heart a leaf ,a flower ,fruit ,or water I accept with joy.</item>
<item>Unto every one that hath shall be given ,and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. Matthew</item>
<item>There is a calmness to a life lived in Gratitude ,a quiet joy.</item>
<item>In ordinary life we hardly realize that we receive a great deal more than we give ,and that it is only with gratitude that life becomes rich.</item>
<item>Lets choose today to quench our thirst for the good life we thinks others lead by acknowledging the good that already exists in our lives. We can then offer the universe the gift of our grateful hearts.</item>
<item>Grace is available for each of us every day our spiritual daily bread but weve got to remember to ask for it with a grateful heart and not worry about whether there will be enough for tomorrow.</item>
<item>Whatever we are waiting for peace of mind ,contentment ,grace ,the inner awareness of simple abundance it will surely come to us ,but only when we are ready to receive it with an open and grateful heart.</item>
<item>Both abundance and lack exist simultaneously in our lives ,as parallel realities. It is always our conscious choice which secret garden we will tend  when we choose not to focus on what is missing from our lives but are grateful for the abundance thats present love ,health ,family ,friends ,work ,the joys of nature and personal pursuits that bring us pleasure the wasteland of illusion falls away and we experience Heaven on earth.</item>
<item>This race is never grateful from the first ,One fills their cup at supper with pure wine ,Which back they give at cross time on a sponge ,In bitter vinegar.</item>
<item>Let us rise up and be thankful ,for if we didnt learn a lot today ,at least we learned a little ,and if we didnt learn a little ,at least we didnt get sick ,and if we got sick ,at least we didnt die so ,let us all be thankful.</item>
<item>Gratitude helps you to grow and expands gratitude brings you and laughter into your life and into the lives of all those around you.</item>
<item>I dont like it when people on the street say smile or cheer up. Its a real cheap line. Im feeling good. Im feeling real grateful for everything. Its a solid time in my life. When people say I look sad ,theyre wrong.</item>
<item>Remember that not to be happy is not to be grateful.</item>
<item>The first step toward greatness is to be honest.</item>
<item>Great men are true men ,the men in whom nature has succeeded. They are not extraordinary they are in the true order. It is the other species of men who are not what they ought to be.</item>
<item>Greatness is a spiritual condition.</item>
<item>The first element of greatness is fundamental humbleness this should not be confused with servility the second is freedom from self the third is intrepid courage ,which ,taken in its widest interpretation ,generally goes with truth and the fourth the power to love although I have put it last ,is the rarest.</item>
<item>We shall never resolve the enigma of the relation between the negative foundations of greatness and that greatness itself.</item>
<item>Because you are a great lord ,you believe yourself to be a great genius. You took the trouble to be born ,but no more.</item>
<item>The dullards envy of brilliant men is always assuaged by the suspicion that they will come to a bad end.</item>
<item>Great men are not always wise.</item>
<item>The herd seek out the great ,not for their sake but for their influence and the great welcome them out of vanity or need.</item>
<item>Great people are meteors designed to burn so that the earth may be lighted.</item>
<item>Greatness be nothing unless it be lasting.</item>
<item>The greatness of a mans power is the measure of his surrender.</item>
<item>All your youth you want to have your greatness taken for granted when you find it taken for granted ,you are unnerved.</item>
<item>No one who has come to true greatness has not felt in some degree that his life belongs to the people ,and what God has given them he gives it for mankind.</item>
<item>False greatness is unsociable and remote conscious of its own frailty ,it hides ,or at least averts its face ,and reveals itself only enough to create an illusion and not be recognized as the meanness that it really is. True greatness is free ,kind ,familiar and popular it lets itself be touched and handled ,it loses nothing by being seen at close quarters the better one knows it ,the more one admires it.</item>
<item>Difficulty ,my brethren ,is the nurse of greatness</item>
<item>The great must submit to the dominion of prudence and of virtue ,or none will long submit to the dominion of the great.</item>
<item>Great men are the guideposts and landmarks in the state.</item>
<item>Sighing that Nature formed but one such man ,and broke the die.</item>
<item>What millions died that Caesar might be great?</item>
<item>All great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous beginning.</item>
<item>The difference between Socrates and Jesus? The great conscious and the immeasurably great unconscious.</item>
<item>No great man lives in vain. The history of the world is but the biography of great men.</item>
<item>All great men are gifted with intuition. They know without reasoning or analysis ,what they need to know.</item>
<item>If you want happiness for an hour take a nap. If you want happiness for a day go fishing. If you want happiness for a month get married. If you want happiness for a year inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime help someone else.</item>
<item>Happiness is like a sunbeam ,which the least shadow intercepts ,while adversity is often as the rain of spring.</item>
<item>If you want to be happy for a year ,plant a garden If you want to be happy for life ,plant a tree.</item>
<item>Happiness is a choice that requires effort at times.</item>
<item>Where one is wise two are happy.</item>
<item>While we pursue happiness ,we flee from contentment.</item>
<item>He is rich who owes nothing.</item>
<item>Happiness is not a horse ,you cannot harness it.</item>
<item>There is no happiness there are only moments of happiness.</item>
<item>Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose.</item>
<item>Three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do ,something to love ,and something to hope for.</item>
<item>Cheerfulness is the best promoter of health and is as friendly to the mind as to the body.</item>
<item>What sunshine is to flowers ,smiles are to humanity. These are but trifles ,to be sure but ,scattered along lifes pathway ,the good they do is inconceivable.</item>
<item>True happiness is of a retired nature ,and an enemy to pomp and noise it arises ,in the first place ,from the enjoyment of ones self ,and in the next from the friendship and conversation of a few select companions.</item>
<item>Happiness is a positive cash flow.</item>

<item>Only one thing has to change for us to know happiness in our lives where we focus our attention.</item>
<item>Most people would rather be certain theyre miserable ,than risk being happy.</item>
<item>Now and then its good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy.</item>
<item> happiness is the highest good ,being a realization and perfect practice of virtue ,which some can attain ,while others have little or none of it </item>
<item>If happiness is activity in accordance with excellence ,it is reasonable that it should be in accordance with the highest excellence.</item>

<item>History is the sum total of the things that could have been avoided.</item>
<item>It is the true office of history to represent the events themselves ,together with the counsels ,and to leave the observations and conclusions thereupon to the liberty and faculty of every mans judgment.</item>
<item>Histories make men wise poets ,witty the mathematics ,subtle natural philosophy ,deep moral ,grave logic and rhetoric ,able to contend.</item>
<item>James Joyce is right about history being a nightmare but it may be that nightmare from which no one can awaken. People are trapped in history and history in trapped in them.</item>
<item>History does not repeat itself. Historians repeat each other.</item>

<item>The main thing is to make history ,not to write it.</item>
<item>Its my belief that history is a wheel. Inconstancy is my very essence ,says the wheel. Rise up on my spokes if you like but dont complain when youre cast back down into the depths. Good time pass away ,but then so do the bad. Mutability is our tragedy ,but its also our hope. The worst of time ,like the best ,are always passing away.</item>

<item>In our wildest aberrations we dream of an equilibrium we have left behind and which we naively expect to find at the end of our errors. Childish presumption which justifies the fact that child nations ,inheriting our follies ,are now directing our history.</item>
<item>History is the distillation of rumor.</item>
<item>Stern accuracy in inquiring ,bold imagination in describing ,these are the cogs on which history soars or flutters and wobbles.</item>
<item>What is home?</item>
<item>A hundred men may make an encampment ,but it takes a woman to make a home.</item>
<item>He makes his home where the living is best.</item>
<item>It matters less to a person where they are born than where they can live.</item>
<item>If I were asked to name the chief benefit of the house ,I should say the house shelters day dreaming ,the house protects the dreamer ,the house allows one to dream in peace.</item>
<item>Houses are built to live in ,and not to look on therefore let use be preferred before uniformity.</item>
<item>The ideal of happiness has always taken material form in the house ,whether cottage or castle it stands for permanence and separation from the world.</item>
<item>Peoples backyards are much more interesting than their front gardens ,and houses that back on to railways are public benefactors.</item>
<item>Be grateful for the home you have ,knowing that at this moment ,all you have is all you need.</item>
<item>There are things you just cant do in life. You cant beat the phone company ,you cant make a waiter see you until hes ready to see you ,and you cant go home again.</item>
<item>The place is very well and quiet and the children only scream in a low voice.</item>
<item>Never weather beaten sail more willing bent to shore.</item>
<item>You are a king by your own fireside ,as much as any monarch in his throne.</item>
<item>A mans home is his wifes castle.</item>
<item>The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown. It may be frail its roof may shake the wind may blow through it the storm may enter the rain may enter but the King of England cannot enter! all his forces dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement!</item>
<item>The home is not the one tame place in the world of adventure. It is the one wild place in the world of rules and set tasks.</item>
<item>Home that blessed word ,which opens to the human heart the most perfect glimpse of Heaven ,and helps to carry it thither ,as on an angels wings.</item>
<item>We shape our dwellings ,and afterwards our dwellings shape us.</item>
<item>There is no place more delightful than ones own fireplace.</item>
<item>In the matter of furnishing ,I find a certain absence of ugliness far worse than ugliness.</item>
<item>Going home must be like going to render an account.</item>
<item>A house is a machine for living in.</item>
<item>Nothing annoys a woman more than to have company drop in unexpectedly and find the house looking as it usually does.</item>
<item>Home is a name ,a word ,it is a strong one stronger than magician ever spoke ,or spirit ever answered to ,in the strongest conjuration.</item>
<item>Drab Habitation of Whom? Tabernacle or Tomb or Dome of Worm or Porch of Gnome or some Elfs Catacomb?</item>
<item>He who has health ,has hope. And he who has hope ,has everything.</item>
<item>Hope for the best ,but prepare for the worst.</item>
<item>He gains a great deal who loses a vain hope.</item>
<item>Hope is the last to abandon the unhappy.</item>
<item>Were it not for hope the heart would break.</item>
<item>May every sunrise hold more promise ,every moonrise hold more peace.</item>
<item>He that waits for a dead mans shoes may long go barefoot.</item>
<item>Hope is the dream of a soul awake.</item>
<item>Quit not certainty for hope.</item>
<item>A misty morning does not signify a cloudy day.</item>
<item>If we hope for what we are not likely to possess ,we act and think in vain ,and make life a greater dream and shadow than it really is.</item>
<item>Hope calculates its scenes for a long and durable life presses forward to imaginary points of bliss and grasps at impossibilities and consequently very often ensnares men into beggary ,ruin and dishonor.</item>
<item>My great hope is to laugh as much as I cry to get my work done and try to love somebody and have the courage to accept the love in return.</item>
<item>Hope is the expectation that something outside of ourselves ,something or someone external ,is going to come to our rescue and we will live happily ever after.</item>
<item>Hope is a waking dream.</item>
<item>Hope is the dream of a waking man.</item>
<item>You have perhaps waited for years to be freed from some need. For a long ,long time you have looked out from the darkness in search of the light ,and have had a difficult problem in life that you have not been able to solve in spite of great efforts. And then ,when the time was fulfilled and God</item>
<item>Still bent to make some port he knows not where ,still standing for some false impossible shore.</item>
<item>Aerodynamically ,the bumble bee shouldnt be able to fly ,but the bumble bee doesnt know it so it goes on flying anyway.</item>
<item>Hope is a good breakfast but a bad supper.</item>
<item>Hope is the parent of faith.</item>
<item>Before you give up hope ,turn back and read the attacks that were made on Lincoln.</item>
<item>Wheres the hope that can abate The grief of hearts thus desolate That can Youths keenest pangs assuage ,And mitigate the gloom of Age? Religion bids the tempest cease ,And ,leads her to a port of peace And on ,the lonely pilot steers Through the lapse of future years.</item>
<item>There is hope for all of us. Well ,anyway ,if you dont die you live through it ,day in ,day out.</item>
<item>No winter lasts forever no spring skips its turn.</item>
<item>One never needs their humor as much a when they argue with a fool.</item>
<item>Many a true word is spoken in jest.</item>
<item>A poor joke must invent its own laughter.</item>
<item>If I have not seen as far as others ,it is because there were giants standing on my shoulders.</item>
<item>I have a fine sense of the ridiculous ,but no sense of humor.</item>
<item>My life has been one great big joke ,a dance thats walked a song thats spoke ,I laugh so hard I almost choke when I think about myself.</item>
<item>The secret to humor is surprise.</item>
<item>Melancholy men are of all others the most witty.</item>
<item>Among those whom I like or admire ,I can find no common denominator ,but among those whom I love ,I can all of them make me laugh.</item>
<item>Imagination was given man to compensate for what he is not ,and a sense of humor to console him for what he is.</item>
<item>A person without a sense of humor is like a wagon without springs jolted by every pebble in the road.</item>
<item>Witticism. A sharp and clever remark ,usually quoted and seldom noted what the Philistine is pleased to call a joke.</item>
<item>Wit. The salt with which the American humorist spoils his intellectual cookery by leaving it out.</item>
<item>We never respect those who amuse us ,however we may smile at their comic powers.</item>
<item>Humor is a spontaneous ,wonderful bit of an outburst that just comes. Its unbridled ,its unplanned ,its full of suprises.</item>
<item>We must laugh at man to avoid crying for him.</item>
<item>Humor is something that thrives between mans aspirations and his limitations. There is more logic in humor than in anything else. Because ,you see ,humor is truth.</item>
<item>For my own part I think no innocent species of wit or pleasantry should be suppressed and that a good pun may be admitted among the smaller excellencies of lively conversation.</item>
<item>Being a funny person does an awful lot of things to you. You feel that you mustnt get serious with people. They dont expect it from you ,and they dont want to see it. Youre not entitled to be serious ,youre a clown ,and they only want you to make them laugh.</item>
<item>A rich mans joke is always funny.</item>
<item>All my humor is based upon destruction and despair. If the whole world were tranquil ,without disease and violence ,Id be standing on the breadline right in back of J. Edgar Hoover.</item>
<item>The role of a comedian is to make the audience laugh ,at a minimum of once every fifteen seconds.</item>
<item>Jesting is often only indigence of intellect.</item>
<item>To appreciate nonsense requires a serious interest in life.</item>
<item>Comedy is a tragedy plus time.</item>
<item>Reality can be beaten with enough imagination.</item>
<item>When you stop having dreams and ideals well ,you might as well stop altogether.</item>
<item>Act as if you have already achieved your goal and it is yours.</item>
<item>Your imagination ,my dear fellow ,is worth more than you imagine.</item>
<item>Imagination is the highest kite one can fly.</item>
<item>We think ,sometimes ,theres not a dragon left. Not one brave knight ,not a single princess gliding through secret forests ,enchanting deer and butterflies with her smile.What a pleasure to be wrong. Princesses ,knights ,enchantments and dragons ,mystery and adventure not only are they here and now ,theyre all that ever lived on earth!Our century ,theyve changed clothes ,of course. Dragons wear government costumes ,today ,and failure suits and disaster outfits. Societys demons screech ,whirl down on us should we lift our eyes from the ground ,dare we turn right at corners weve been told to turn left. So crafty have appearances become that princesses and knights can be hidden from each other ,can be hidden from themselves.</item>
<item>To fly as fast as thought ,to anywhere that is. He said ,you must begin by knowing that you have already arrived.</item>
<item>Man is an imagining being.</item>
<item>Images also help me find and realise ideas. I look at hundreds of very different ,contrasting images and I pinch details from them ,rather like people who eat from other people</item>
<item>Imagination is the air of mind.</item>
<item>The Christian tradition was passed on to me as a great rich mixture ,a bouillabaisse of human imagination and wonder brewed from the richness of individual lives.</item>
<item>The soul without imagination is what an observatory would be without a telescope.</item>
<item>Sentiment is the ripened fruit of fantasy.</item>
<item>Nevertheless ,the consuming hunger of the uncritical mind for what it imagines to be certainty or finality impels it to feast upon shadows in the prevailing famine of substance.</item>
<item>The human imagination has great difficulty in living strictly within the confines of a materialist practice or philosophy. It dreams ,like a dog in its basket ,of hares in the open.</item>
<item>If you close your eyes ,you could just as well imagine me to be vintage Ali MacGraw ,circa 1968.</item>
<item>The way we imagine ourselves to appear to another person is an essential element in our conception of ourselves. In other words ,I am not what I think I am ,and I am not what you think I am. I am what I think you think I am.</item>
<item>To me this world is all one continued vision of fancy or imagination ,and I feel flattered when I am told so. What is it sets Homer ,Virgil and Milton in so high a rank of art? Why is the Bible more entertaining and instructive than any other book? Is it not because they are addressed to the imagination ,which is spiritual sensation ,and but immediately to the understanding or reason?</item>
<item>What is now proved was only once imagined.</item>
<item>To see a world in a grain of sand,And a heaven in a wild flower,Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,And eternity in an hour.</item>
<item>The human race is governed by its imagination.</item>
<item>Imagination rules the world.</item>
<item>By going over your day in imagination before you begin it ,you can begin acting successfully at any moment.</item>
<item>To reduce the imagination to a state of slavery even though it would mean the elimination of what is commonly called happiness is to betray all sense of absolute justice within oneself. Imagination alone offers me some intimation of what can be.</item>
<item>When I was a kid ,I used to imagine animals running under my bed. I told my dad ,and he solved the problem quickly. He cut the legs off the bed.</item>
<item>God helps them that help themselves.</item>
<item>God loves to help him who strives to help himself.</item>
<item>The highest manifestation of life consists in this that a being governs its own actions. A thing which is always subject to the direction of another is somewhat of a dead thing.</item>
<item>To be ones own master is to be the slave of self.</item>
<item>The best way to get yourself a reputation as a dangerous citizen is to go about repeating the very phrases which our founding fathers used in the struggle for independence.</item>
<item>Without moral and intellectual independence ,there is no anchor for national independence.</item>
<item>We carry our homes within us which enables us to fly.</item>
<item>No one can build his security upon the nobleness of another person.</item>
<item>Nature never said to me Do not be poor still less did she say Be rich her cry to me was always Be independent.</item>
<item>No man who is not willing to help himself has any right to apply to his friends ,or to the gods.</item>
<item>Be your own palace ,or the world is your jail.</item>
<item>The ship of heaven guides itself and will not accept a wooden rudder.</item>
<item>This gives force to the strong that the multitude have no habit of self reliance or original action.</item>
<item>The best lightning rod for your protection is your own spine.</item>
<item>No one can cheat you out of ultimate success but yourself.</item>
<item>Self reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators ,but names and customs.</item>
<item>There is no one subsists by himself alone.</item>
<item>I am lord of myself ,accountable to none.</item>
<item>There is no dependence that can be sure but a dependence upon ones self.</item>
<item>In the word of no master am I bound to believe.</item>
<item>The strongest man in the world is he who stands alone.</item>
<item>Its easy to be independent when youve got money. But to be independent when you havent got a thing thats the Lords test.</item>
<item>If it is to be ,it is up to me.</item>
<item>Self determination has to mean that the leader is your individual gut ,and heart ,and mind or were talking about power ,again ,and its rather well known impurities. Who is really going to care whether you live or die and who is going to know the most intimate motivation for your laughter and your tears is the only person to be trusted to speak for you and to decide what you will or will not do.</item>
<item>I equally dislike the favor of the public with the love of a woman they are both a cloying treacle to the wings of independence.</item>
<item>Inspiration is wonderful when it happens ,but the writer must develop an approach for the rest of the time</item>
<item>The inspiration of the almighty gives man understanding.</item>
<item>Wisdom is supreme therefore make a full effort to get wisdom. Esteem her and she will exalt you embrace her and she will honor you.</item>
<item>When you do not know what you are doing and what you are doing is the best that is inspiration.</item>
<item>Stung by the splendor of a sudden thought.</item>
<item>Out of the closets and into the museums ,libraries ,architectural monuments ,concert halls ,bookstores ,recording studios and film studios of the world. Everything belongs to the inspired and dedicated thief  Words ,colors ,light ,sounds ,stone ,wood ,bronze belong to the living artist. They belong to anyone who can use them. Loot the Louver! A bas l Originality ,the sterile and assertive ego that imprisons us as it creates. Vive le sol pure ,shameless ,total. We are not responsible. Steal anything in sight.</item>
<item>There never was a great soul that did not have some divine inspiration.</item>
<item>Invention flags ,his brain goes muddy ,and black despair succeeds brown study.</item>
<item>Inspiration may be a form of super consciousness ,or perhaps of subconsciousness I wouldnt know. But I am sure it is the antithesis of self consciousness.</item>
<item>The greatest inspiration is often born of desperation.</item>
<item>Had it not been for you ,I should have remained what I was when we first met ,a prejudiced ,narrow minded being ,with contracted sympathies and false knowledge ,wasting my life on obsolete trifles ,and utterly insensible to the privilege of living in this wondrous age of change and progress.</item>
<item>Most of us who turn to any subject we love remember some morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to reach down an untried volume ,or sat with parted lips listening to a new talker ,or for very lack of books began to listen to the voices within ,as the first traceable beginning of our love.</item>
<item>The torpid artist seeks inspiration at any cost ,by virtue or by vice ,by friend or by fiend ,by prayer or by wine.</item>
<item>None of us will ever accomplish anything excellent or commanding except when he listens to this whisper which is heard by him alone.</item>
<item>Here is the secret of inspiration Tell yourself that thousands and tens of thousands of people ,not very intelligent and certainly no more intelligent than the rest of us ,have mastered problems as difficult as those that now baffle you.</item>
<item>Without inspiration the best powers of the mind remain dormant ,they is a fuel in us which needs to be ignited with sparks.</item>
<item>Prepare your mind to receive the best that life has to offer.</item>
<item>The supreme prayer of my heart is not to be learned ,rich ,famous ,powerful ,or good ,but simply to be radiant. I desire to radiate health ,cheerfulness ,calm courage ,and good will. I wish to live without hate ,whim ,jealousy ,envy ,fear. I wish to be simple ,honest ,frank ,natural ,clean in mind and clean in body ,unaffected as ready to say I do not know ,if it be so ,and to meet all men on an absolute equality to face any obstacle and meet every difficulty unabashed and unafraid.I wish others to live their lives ,too up to their highest ,fullest ,and best. To that end I pray that I may never meddle ,interfere ,dictate ,give advice that is not wanted ,or assist when my services are not needed. If I can help people ,Ill do it by giving them a chance to help themselves and if I can uplift or inspire ,let it be by example ,inference ,and suggestion ,rather than by injunction and dictation. That is to say ,I desire to be radiant to radiate life.</item>
<item>I want to put a ding in the universe.</item>
<item>What this country needs is more people to inspire others with confidence ,and fewer people to discourage any initiative in the right direction more to get into the thick of things ,fewer to sit on the sidelines ,merely finding fault more to point out whats right with the world ,and fewer to keep harping on whats wrong with it and more who are interested in lighting candles ,and fewer who blow them out.</item>
<item>Quotes are nothing but inspiration for the uninspired.</item>
<item>People are like stained glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out,but when the darkness sets in,their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within.</item>
<item>Never allow anyone to rain on your parade and thus cast a pall of gloom and defeat on the entire day. Remember that no talent ,no self denial ,no brains ,no character ,are required to set up in the fault finding business. Nothing external can have any power over you unless you permit it. Your time is too precious to be sacrificed in wasted days combating the menial forces of hate ,jealously ,and envy. Guard your fragile life carefully. Only God can shape a flower ,but any foolish child can pull it to pieces.</item>
<item>I didnt have to think up so much as a comma or a semicolon it was all given ,straight from the celestial recording room. Weary ,I would beg for a break ,an intermission ,time enough ,lets say ,to go to the toilet or take a breath of fresh air on the balcony. Nothing doing!</item>
<item>You beat your Pate ,and fancy Wit will come Knock as you please ,theres no body at home.</item>
<item>My sole inspiration is a telephone call from a director.</item>
<item>The glow of inspiration warms us it is a holy rapture.</item>
<item>The trouble with so many of us is that we underestimate the power of simplicity. We have a tendency it seems to over complicate our lives and forget whats important and whats not. We tend to mistake movement for achievement. We tend to focus on activities instead of results. And as the pace of life continues to race along in the outside world ,we forget that we have the power to control our lives regardless of whats going on outside.</item>
<item>Write while the heat is in you. The writer who postpones the recording of his thoughts uses an iron which has cooled to burn a hole with. He cannot inflame the minds of his audience.</item>
<item>An idea ran back and forward in his head like a blind man ,knocking over the solid furniture.</item>
<item>the best way to get something done is to begin.</item>
<item>Respect human talent ,respond to genius ,recognize reality ,admire truth and beauty ,realize the meaning of the rare flower Reason.</item>
<item>You dont need intelligence to have luck ,but you do need luck to have intelligence.</item>
<item>Its good to be clever ,but not to show it.</item>
<item>She was short on intellect ,but long on shape.</item>
<item>Intelligence I was asked tonight why I refuse to have truck with intellectuals after business hours. But of course I won t. 1. I am not an intellectual. Two minutes talk with Aldous Huxley ,William Glock ,or any of the New Statesman crowd would expose me utterly. 2. I am too tired after my days work to man the intellectual palisade. 3. When my work is finished I want to eat ,drink ,smoke ,and relax. 4. I dont know very much ,but what I do know I know better than anybody ,and I dont want to argue about it. I know what I think about an actor or an actress ,and am not interested in what anybody else thinks. My mind is not a bed to be made and re made.</item>
<item>Ive never been an intellectual but I have this look.</item>
<item>Clever people will recognize and tolerate nothing but cleverness.</item>
<item>Cleverness is serviceable for everything ,sufficient for nothing.</item>
<item>People generally treat me like Im very intelligent and really ,Im much less intelligent than she is. Scully is insanely intelligent.</item>
<item>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.</item>
<item>Wit is educated insolence.</item>
<item>To the man in the street ,who ,Im sorry to say ,is a keen observer of life. The word Intellectual suggests straight away. A man whos untrue to his wife.</item>
<item>God has placed no limits to the exercise of the intellect he has given us ,on this side of the grave.</item>
<item>Ive been called many things ,but never an intellectual.</item>
<item>Mother is far too clever to understand anything she does not like.</item>
<item>The weak in courage is strong in cunning.</item>
<item>The intellectual is a middle class product if he is not born into the class he must soon insert himself into it ,in order to exist. He is the fine nervous flower of the bourgeoisie.</item>
<item>If we listened to our intellect ,wed never have a love affair. Wed never have a friendship. Wed never go into business ,because wed be cynical. Well ,thats nonsense. Youve got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down.</item>
<item>To me ,being an intellectual doesnt mean knowing about intellectual issues it means taking pleasure in them.</item>
<item>The cynic never grows up ,but commits intellectual suicide.</item>
<item>Clever men are good ,but they are not the best.</item>
<item>To label me an intellectual is a misunderstanding of what that is.</item>
<item>A person of intellect without energy added to it ,is a failure.</item>
<item>Merely having an open mind is nothing the object of opening the mind ,as of opening the mouth ,is to shut it again on something solid.</item>
<item>A large section of the intelligentsia seems wholly devoid of intelligence.</item>
<item>The doctrine of human equality reposes on this that there is no man really clever who has not found that he is stupid.</item>
<item>One joy scatters a hundred grieves.</item>
<item>In this world ,full often ,our joys are only the tender shadows which our sorrows cast.</item>
<item>I have no greater joy then to hear that my children walk in truth. John 4</item>
<item>Rejoice in the Lord always again I will say ,rejoice! Philippians 4 4</item>
<item>He who binds to himself a joy doth the winged life destroy. But he who kisses the joy as it flies lives in Eternitys sunrise.</item>
<item>Tranquil pleasures last the longest we are not fitted to bear the burden of great joys.</item>
<item>When you were born ,you cried and everybody else was happy. The only question that matters is this When you die ,will YOU be happy when everybody else is crying?</item>
<item>Joy is the feeling of grinning on the inside.</item>
<item>Real joy comes not from ease or riches or from the praise of men ,but from doing something worthwhile.</item>
<item>With coarse rice to eat ,with water to drink ,and my bent arm for a pillow I have still joy in the midst of all these things.</item>
<item>Uncertainty and expectation are the joys of life.</item>
<item>We ask God to forgive us for our evil thoughts and evil temper ,but rarely ,if ever ask Him to forgive us for our sadness.</item>
<item>Tis so much joy! Tis so much joy! If I should fail ,what poverty! And yet ,as poor as I Have ventured all upon a throw Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so this side the victory!</item>
<item>For present joys are more to flesh and blood than a dull prospect of a distant good.</item>
<item>All human joys are swift of wing ,For heaven doth so allot it That when you get an easy thing ,You find you havent got it.</item>
<item>Unexplained joy is always so keen that  it seems to hold enough to reconcile one to the inevitable.</item>
<item>Joys divided are increased.</item>
<item>One can endure sorrow alone ,but it takes two to be glad.</item>
<item>Occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words. Their meanings can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart.</item>
<item>I sometimes wander whether all pleasures are not substitutes for joy.</item>
<item>Joy ,rather than happiness ,is the goal of life ,for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings. It is based on the experience of ones identity as a being of worth and dignity.</item>
<item>The most profound joy has more of gravity than of gaiety in it.</item>
<item>Happy is the person who not only sings ,but feels Gods eye is on the sparrow ,and knows He watches over me. To be simply ensconced in God is true joy.</item>
<item>Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls. A joyful heart is the inevitable result of a heart burning with love</item>
<item>A leaf fluttered in through the window this morning ,as if supported by the rays of the sun ,a bird settled on the fire escape ,joy in the task of coffee ,joy accompanied me as I walked</item>
<item>When you cease to strive to understand ,then you will know without understanding.</item>
<item>He who knows little quickly tells it.</item>
<item>He who does not know one thing knows another</item>
<item>You dont know how much you know until you know how much you dont know.</item>
<item>Only the spoon knows what is stirring in the pot.</item>
<item>Who knows most believes least.</item>
<item>No wonder lasts over three days.</item>
<item>It is nothing for one to know something unless another knows you know it.</item>
<item>Men can acquire knowledge ,but not wisdom. Some of the greatest fools ever known were learned men.</item>
<item>How do you know so much about everything? was asked of a very wise and intelligent man and the answer was By never being afraid or ashamed to ask questions as to anything of which I was ignorant.</item>
<item>I find that a great part of the information I have ,was acquired by looking up something and finding something else on the way.</item>
<item>Knowledge is that which ,next to virtue ,truly raises one person above another.</item>
<item>Man knows more than he understands.</item>
<item>It was through the feeling of wonder that men now and at first began to philosophize.</item>
<item>Real knowledge ,like everything else of value ,is not to be obtained easily. It must be worked for ,studied for ,thought for ,and ,more that all ,must be prayed for.</item>
<item>In the life of a man ,his time is but a moment ,his being an incessant flux ,his senses a dim rushlight ,his body a prey of worms ,his soul an unquiet eddy ,his fortune dark ,and his fame doubtful. In short ,all that is of the body is as coursing waters ,all that is of the soul as dreams and vapours life a warfare ,a brief sojourning in an alien land and after repute ,oblivion. Where ,then ,can man find the power to guide and guard his steps? In one thing and one alone the love of knowledge.</item>
<item>Be curious always! For knowledge will not acquire you you must acquire it.</item>
<item>For knowledge itself is power. always seen as Knowledge is power and appears inscribed on the wall of the north lobby of The Library of Congress The Thomas Jefferson Building </item>
<item>Knowledge and human power are synonymous.</item>
<item>Knowledge is power ,but enthusiasm pulls the switch.</item>
<item>I think knowing what you cannot do is more important than knowing what you can.</item>
<item>Knowledge is the best eraser in the world for disharmony ,distrust ,despair ,and the endless physical deficiencies of man.</item>
<item>I have tried to know absolutely nothing about a great many things ,and I have succeeded fairly well.</item>
<item>We have more information now than we can use ,and less knowledge and understanding than we need. Indeed ,we seem to collect information because we have the ability to do so ,but we are so busy collecting it that we havent devised a means of using it. The true measure of any society is not what it knows but what it does with what it knows.</item>
<item>It is not good to know more unless we do more with what we already know.</item>
<item>A kind word can warm three months of winter.</item>
<item>Sometimes you must be cruel to be kind.</item>
<item>Kindness is the only service that will stand the storm of life and not wash out. It will wear well and be remembered long after the prism of politeness or the complexion of courtesy has faded away. When I am gone ,I hope it can be said of me that I plucked a thistle and planted a flower wherever I thought a flower would grow.</item>
<item>Kindness begets kindness.</item>
<item>One can pay back the loan of gold ,but one lies forever in debt to those who are kind.</item>
<item>Kind words are worth much and they cost little.</item>
<item>There is no sickness worse for me than words that to be kind must lie.</item>
<item>No Act of Kindness ,no matter how small ,is ever wasted.</item>
<item>The flower of kindness will grow. Maybe not now ,but it will some day. And in kind that kindness will flow ,For kindness grows in this way.</item>
<item>The good deed you do today For a brother or sister in need Will come back to you some day For humanitys a circle in deed.</item>
<item>It is  axiomatic that we should all think of ourselves as being more sensitive than other people because ,when we are insensitive in our dealings with others ,we cannot be aware of it at the time conscious insensitivity is a self contradiction.</item>
<item>Kindness is wisdom.</item>
<item>Shall we make a new rule of life from tonight always to try to be a little kinder than is necessary? Often paraphrased as Always be a little kinder than necessary.</item>
<item>In necessary things ,unity in doubtful things ,liberty in all things ,charity.</item>
<item>A kind and compassionate act is often its own reward.</item>
<item>Compassion has no place in the natural order of the world which operates on the basis of necessity. Compassion opposes this order and is therefore best thought of as being in some way supernatural.</item>
<item>I know the compassion of others is a relief at first. I dont despise it. But it cant quench pain ,it slips through your soul as through a sieve. And when our suffering has been dragged from one pity to another ,as from one mouth to another ,we can no longer respect or love it.</item>
<item>Out of compassion I destroy the darkness of their ignorance. From within them I light the lamp of wisdom and dispel all darkness from their lives.</item>
<item>Be ye kind one to another ,tenderhearted ,forgiving one another ,even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven you. Ephesians</item>
<item>Kindness is a language the dumb can speak and the deaf can hear and understand.</item>
<item>Compassion is sometimes the fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody elses skin. It is the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too.</item>
<item>How wretched is the person who hangs on by the favors of the powerful.</item>
<item>The heart and benevolent and kind the most resembles God.</item>
<item>Have you had a kindness shown? Pass it on twas not given for thee alone ,Pass it on Let it travel down the years ,Let it wipe anothers tears ,Till in Heaven the deed appears ,Pass it on.</item>
<item>The dew of compassion is a tear.</item>
<item>The person who lives with cripples will soon learn to limp.</item>

<item>Power lasts ten years influence not more than a hundred.</item>
<item>The first requirement of a statesman is that he be dull. This is not always easy to achieve.</item>
<item>The chief executive who knows his strengths and weaknesses as a leader is likely to be far more effective than the one who remains blind to them. He also is on the road to humility that priceless attitude of openness to life that can help a manager absorb mistakes ,failures ,or personal shortcomings.</item>
<item>A leader knows whats best to do a manager knows merely how best to do it.</item>
<item>Every ruler is harsh whose laws is new.</item>
<item>The leadership instinct you are born with is the backbone. You develop the funny bone and the wishbone that go with it.</item>
<item>Skill in the art of communication is crucial to a leaders success. He can accomplish nothing unless he can communicate effectively.</item>
<item>Every life is a profession of faith ,and exercises an inevitable and silent influence.</item>
<item>The minute a person whose word means a great deal to others dare to take the open hearted and courageous way ,many others follow.</item>
<item>All poets adore explosions ,thunderstorms ,tornadoes ,conflagrations ,ruins ,scenes of spectacular carnage. The poetic imagination is therefore not at all a desirable quality in a chief of state.</item>
<item>If you have fear of those that command you ,spare those that obey you.</item>
<item>A leader is a person you will follow to a place you wouldnt go by yourself.</item>
<item>The first task of a leader is to keep hope alive.</item>
<item>He is greatest whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own.</item>

<item>Biography is one of the new terrors of death.</item>
<item>Every autobiography is concerned with two characters ,a Don Quixote ,the Ego ,and a Sancho Panza ,the Self.</item>
<item>Biography should be written by an acute enemy.</item>
<item>Every man</item>
<item>Anyone who attempts to relate his life loses himself in the immediate. One can only speak of another.</item>
<item>Just as there is nothing between the admirable omelet and the intolerable ,so with autobiography.</item>
<item>Reminiscences ,even extensive ones ,do not always amount to an autobiography. For autobiography has to do with time ,with sequence and what makes up the continuous flow of life. Here ,I am talking of a space ,of moments and discontinuities. For even if months and years appear here ,it is in the form they have in the moment of recollection. This strange form it may be called fleeting or eternal is in neither case the stuff that life is made of.</item>
<item>Autobiography begins with a sense of being alone. It is an orphan form.</item>
<item>In writing biography ,fact and fiction shouldnt be mixed. And if they are ,the fictional points should be printed in red ink ,the facts printed in black ink.</item>
<item>Everyone must leave something behind when he dies ,my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die ,and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted ,youre there. It doesnt matter what you do ,he said ,so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something thats like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching ,he said. The lawn cutter might just as well not have been there at all the gardener will be there a lifetime.</item>
<item>A mans memory is bound to be a distortion of his past in accordance with his present interests ,and the most faithful autobiography is likely to mirror less what a man was than what he has become.</item>
<item>Biographical data ,even those recorded in the public registers ,are the most private things one has ,and to declare them openly is rather like facing a psychoanalyst.</item>
<item>When you write down your life ,every page should contain something no one has ever heard about.</item>
<item>Such reproductions may not interest the reader but after all ,this is my autobiography ,not his he is under no obligation to read further in it he was under none to begin. A modest or inhibited autobiography is written without entertainment to the writer and read with distrust by the reader.</item>
<item>A well written life is almost as rare as a well spent one.</item>
<item>History is the essence of innumerable biographies.</item>
<item>If those gentlemen would let me alone I should be much obliged to them. I would say ,as Shakespeare would say  Sweet Friend ,for Jesus sake forbear.</item>
<item>No sooner does a great man depart ,and leave his character as public property ,than a crowd of little men rushes towards it. There they are gathered together ,blinking up to it with such vision as they have ,scanning it from afar ,hovering round it this way and that ,each cunningly endeavoring ,by all arts ,to catch some reflex of it in the little mirror of himself.</item>
<item>There are people who can write their memoirs with a reasonable amount of honesty ,and there are people who simply cannot take themselves seriously enough. I think I might be the first to admit that the sort of reticence which prevents a man from exploiting his own personality is really an inverted sort of egotism.</item>
<item>Life is a bed of water filling from many springs and we seem not to know when one gushing flow will oer flood the banks only to be succeeded by a drought.</item>
<item>Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body ,but rather to skid in broadside ,thoroughly used up ,totally worn out ,and loudly proclaiming</item>
<item>May God bless you to live as long as you want to and want to as long as you live!</item>
<item>Learn from yesterday ,live for today ,hope for tomorrow.</item>
<item>Some people weave burlap into the fabric of our lives ,and some weave gold thread. Both contribute to make the whole picture beautiful and unique.</item>
<item>Enjoy life. Theres plenty of time to be dead.</item>
<item>He who allows his day to pass by without practicing generosity and enjoying lifes pleasures is like a blacksmiths bellows. He breathes ,but does not live.</item>
<item>A light heart lives long.</item>
<item>Live today for tomorrow it will all be history.</item>
<item>Young people talk of what they are doing old people of what they have done and fools of what they have a mind to do.</item>
<item>Life is an onion and one cries while peeling it.</item>
<item>In the morning of life ,work in the mid day give council in the evening ,pray.</item>
<item>Life is a bridge. Cross over it ,but build no house on it.</item>
<item>There are four things every person has more of than they know sins ,debt ,years ,and foes.</item>
<item>To live with the conscious knowledge of the shadow of uncertainty ,with the knowledge that disaster or tragedy could strike at any time to be afraid and to know and acknowledge your fear ,and still to live creatively and with unstinting love that is to live with grace.</item>
<item>I do not want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well.</item>
<item>Life is like a grapefruit. Its orange and squishy  ,  and has a few pips in it ,and some folks have half a one for breakfast.</item>
<item>Life is wasted on the living.</item>
<item> We make provisions for this life as if it were never to have an end ,and for the other life as though it were never to have a beginning.</item>
<item>The less routine the more life.</item>
<item>He who is not impatient is not in love.</item>
<item>Who travels for love finds a thousand miles not longer than one.</item>
<item>A man in love mistakes a pimple for a dimple.</item>
<item>It is easier to guard a sack full of fleas than a girl in love.</item>
<item>He that plants trees loves others besides himself.</item>
<item>You dont love a woman because she is beautiful ,but she is beautiful because you love her.</item>
<item>If you love somebody ,let them go. If they return ,they were always yours. If they dont ,they never were.</item>
<item>Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get ,its what you are expected to give which is everything.</item>
<item>In love ,there is always one who kisses and one who offers the cheek.</item>
<item>A heart that loves is always young.</item>
<item>It is easy to halve the potato where there is love.</item>
<item>Love laughs at locksmiths.</item>
<item>Love rules his kingdom without a sword.</item>
<item>Follow love and it will flee ,flee love and it will follow.</item>
<item>Love can neither be bought or sold ,its only price is love.</item>
<item>Blue eyes say ,Love me or I die black eyes say ,Love me or I kill thee.</item>
<item>All my life I have had a choice of hate and love. I chose love and I am here.</item>
<item>Everyone admits that love is wonderful and necessary ,yet no one agrees on just what it is.</item>
<item>There is a law that man should love his neighbor as himself. In a few hundred years it should be as natural to mankind as breathing or the upright gait but if he does not learn it he must perish.</item>
<item>And ,oh ,how blessed is it thus to meet! To feel that vanished years have not estranged us,distance has not diminished love ,that we are to each other even as we parted to feel again the fond kiss ,to hear once more the accents of a voice which to us has been for years so still ,a voice that brings with it the gush of memory! Past days flit before us feelings ,thoughts ,hopes ,we deemed were dead ,all rise again ,summoned by that secret witchery ,the well remembered though long silent voice. Let years ,long ,lingering ,saddening years drag on their chain ,let youth have given place to manhood ,manhood to age ,still will it be the same the voice we once have loved ,and deemed to us for ever still oh ,time ,and grief ,and blighted hope will be forgotten ,and youth ,in its undimmed and joyous beauty ,its glow of generous feelings ,its bright anticipations ,all ,all again be ours.</item>
<item>Are you ready to cut off your head and place your foot on it? If so ,come Love awaits you! Love is not grown in a garden ,nor sold in the marketplace whether you are a king or a servant ,the price is your head ,and nothing less. Yes ,the cost of the elixir of love is your head! Do you hesitate? 0 miser ,It is cheap at that price!</item>
<item>Love is a great beautifier.</item>
<item>The Impossible Generalized Man today is the critic who believes in loving those unworthy of love as well as those worthy yet believes this only insofar as no personal risk is entailed. Meaning he loves no one ,worthy or no. This is what makes him impossible.</item>
<item>I was nauseous and tingly all over. I was either in love or I had smallpox.</item>
<item>Sex alleviates tension. Love causes it.</item>
<item>Where love is concerned ,too much is not even enough.</item>
<item>When we understand that man is the only animal who must create meaning ,who must open a wedge into neutral nature ,we already understand the essence of love. Love is the problem of an animal who must find life ,create a dialogue with nature in order to experience his own being.</item>
<item>Young love is a flame very pretty ,often very hot and fierce ,but still only light and flickering. The love of the older and disciplined heart is as coals ,deep burning ,unquenchable.</item>
<item>Love is the river of life in the world.</item>
<item>I never knew how to worship until I knew how to love.</item>
<item>Love ceases to be a pleasure ,when it ceases to be a secret.</item>
<item>Honor the ocean of love.</item>
<item>The opposite of love is not to hate but to separate. If love and hate have something in common it is because ,in both cases ,their energy is that of bringing and holding together</item>
<item>Love seeks no cause beyond itself and no fruit it is its own fruit ,its own enjoyment. I love because I love I love in order that I may love.</item>
<item>Let no one believe that he has received the divine kiss ,if he knows the truth without loving it or loves it without understanding it. But blessed is that kiss whereby not only is God recognized but also the Father is loved for there is never full knowledge without perfect love.</item>
<item>All the pictures that hung in my memory before I knew you have faded and given place to our radient moments together. Now I cannot live apart from you Your words are my food ,your breath my wine. You are everything to me.</item>
<item>Set your affection on things above ,not on things on the earth. Colossians 3 2</item>
<item>We know that we have passed from death into life ,because we love  1 John 3 14</item>
<item>And this I pray ,that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment. Philippians 1 9</item>

<item>Stay me with flagons ,comfort me with apples for I am sick of love. The Song Of Solomon 2 5</item>

<item>Do not keep the alabaster boxes of your love and tenderness sealed up until your friends are dead. Fill their lives with sweetness ,speak cheering words while their ears can hear ,and while their hearts can be thrilled and made happier by them. George</item>
<item>Every day I live I am more convinced that the waste of life lies in the love we have not given ,the powers we have not used ,the selfish prudence that will risk nothing and which ,shirking pain ,misses happiness as well.</item>
<item>Love is the word used to label the sexual excitement of the young ,the habituation of the middle aged ,and the mutual dependence of the old.</item>
<item>You cant put a price tag on love ,but you can on all its accessories.</item>
<item> One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.</item>
<item>All thoughts ,all passions ,all delightsWhatever stirs this mortal frameAll are but ministers of LoveAnd feed His sacred flame.</item>
<item>Sympathy constitutes friendship but in love there is a sort of antipathy ,or opposing passion. Each strives to be the other ,and both together make up one whole.</item>
<item>Friendship often ends in love but love in friendship never.</item>
<item>If you cannot inspire a woman with love of you ,fill her above the brim with love of herself all that runs over will be yours.</item>
<item>Love is an alliance of friendship and animalism if the former predominates it is passion exalted and refined if the latter ,gross and sensual.</item>
<item>To love a thing means wanting it to live.</item>
<item>Can there be a love which does not make demands on its object?</item>
<item>If theres delight in love ,Tis when I see that heart ,which others bleed for ,bleed for me.</item>
<item>We love but once ,for once only are we perfectly equipped for loving.</item>
<item>There is no pain equal to that which two lovers can inflict on one another. This should be made clear to all who contemplate such a union. The avoidance of this pain is the beginning of wisdom ,for it is strong enough to contaminate the rest of our lives.</item>
<item>Woe to the man whose heart has not learned while young to hope ,to love and to put its trust in life.</item>

<item>Love is the extra effort we make in our dealings with those whom we do not like and once you understand that ,you understand all. This idea that love overtakes you is nonsense.

<item>Like a celestial chaperon ,the placebo leads us through the uncharted passageways of mind and gives us a greater sense of infinity than if we were to spend all our days with our eyes hypnotically glued to the giant telescope at Mt. Palomar. What we see ultimately is that the placebo isnt really necessary and that the mind can carry out its difficult and wondrous missions unprompted by little pills. The placebo is only a tangible object made essential in an age that feels uncomfortable with intangibles ,an age that prefers to think that every inner effect must have an outer cause. Since it has size and shape and can be hand held ,the placebo satisfies the contemporary craving for visible mechanisms and visible answers  The placebo ,then ,is an emissary between the will to live and the body.</item>

<item>Men are not to be told anything they might find too painful the secret depths of human nature ,the sordid physicalities ,might overwhelm or damage them.

<item>Left to itself the masculine imagination has very little appreciation for the here and now it prefers to dwell on what is absent ,on what has been or may be. If men are more punctual than women ,it is because they know that ,without the external discipline of clock time ,they would never get anything done.</item>
<item>The masculine imagination lives in a state of perpetual revolt against the limitations of human life. In theological terms ,one might say that all men ,left to themselves ,become gnostics.

<item>In peace we can make many of them ignore good and evil entirely in danger ,the issue is forced upon them in a guise to which even we cannot blind them. There is here a cruel dilemma before us. If we promoted justice and charity among men ,we should be playing directly into the Enemys hands but if we guide them to the opposite behaviour ,this sooner or later produces for He permits it to produce a war or a revolution ,and the undisguisable issue of cowardice or courage awakes thousands of men from moral stupor.This ,indeed ,is probably one of the Enemys motives for creating a dangerous world a world in which moral issues really come to the point. He sees as well as you do that courage is not simply one of the virtues ,but the form of every virtue at the testing point ,which means ,at the point of highest reality. A chastity or honesty ,or mercy ,which yieldsto danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions. Pilate was merciful till it became risky.</item>

<item>The only immorality is not to do what one has to do when one has to do it.</item>
<item>Moral excellence comes about as a result of habit. We become just by doing just acts ,temperate by doing temperate acts ,brave by doing brave acts.</item>
<item>The moral virtues ,then ,are produced in us neither by nature nor against nature. Nature ,indeed ,prepares in us the ground for their reception ,but their complete formation is the product of habit.</item>
<item>Ah! How neatly tied ,in these people ,is the umbilical cord of morality! Since they left their mothers they have never sinned ,have they? They are apostles ,they are the descendants of priests one can only wonder from what source they draw their indignation ,and above all how much they have pocketed to do this ,and in any case what it has done for them.</item>
<item>Never let your sense of morals get in the way of doing whats right.</item>
<item>While moral rules may be propounded by authority the fact that these were so propounded would not validate them.</item>
<item>Im as pure as the driven slush.</item>
<item>The essence of morality is a questioning about morality and the decisive move of human life is to use ceaselessly all light to look for the origin of the opposition between good and evil.</item>
<item>Morality is character and conduct such as is required by the circle or community in which the mans life happens to be placed. It shows how much good men require of us.</item>
<item>I have never regarded politics as the arena of morals. It is the arena of interest.</item>
<item>Bad company ruins good morals.</item>
<item>There is a perennial and unobtrusive view that morality consists in such things as telling the truth ,paying ones debts ,respecting ones parents and doing no voluntary harm to anyone. Those are all things easy to say and hard to do they do not attract much attention ,and win little honor in the world.</item>
<item>Moralitys not practical. Moralitys a gesture. A complicated gesture learnt from books.</item>
<item>Compound for sins they are inclined to by damning those they have no mind to.</item>
<item>Though sages may pour out their wisdoms treasure ,there is no sterner moralist than pleasure.</item>
<item>For the superior morality ,of which we hear so much ,we too would desire to be thankful at the same time ,it were but blindness to deny that this superior morality is properly rather an inferior criminality ,produced not by greater love of Virtue ,but by greater perfection of Police and of that far subtler and stronger Police ,called Public Opinion.</item>
<item>Everythings got a moral ,if only you can find it.</item>
<item>It is far easier for a woman to lead a blameless life than it is for a man all she has to do is to avoid sexual intercourse like the plague.</item>
<item>The person is always happy who is in the presence of something they cannot know in full. A person as advanced far in the study of morals who has mastered the difference between pride and vanity.</item>
<item>Conscience ,the sense of right ,the power of perceiving moral distinctions ,the power of discerning between justice and injustice ,excellence and baseness ,is the highest faculty given us by God ,the whole foundation of our responsibility ,and our sole capacity for religion. God ,in giving us conscience ,has implanted a principle within us which forbids us to prostrate ourselves before mere power ,or to offer praise where we do not discover worth.</item>
<item>What is light without dark? Right without left? What is goodness without the option to be evil?</item>
<item>I cannot believe that this country cannot come together around some values what these kids need is a moral life  the issue is not ideas ,it is conduct. The real question is how we reach these young people morally ,and what do we bring to them.</item>
<item>Corruption is like a ball of snow ,once its set a rolling it must increase.</item>
<item>Music ,the greatest good that mortals know ,And all of heaven we have below.</item>
<item>Nothing is capable of being well set to music that is not nonsense.</item>
<item>Mozart has the classic purity of light and the blue ocean Beethoven the romantic grandeur which belongs to the storms of air and sea ,and while the soul of Mozart seems to dwell on the ethereal peaks of Olympus ,that of Beethoven climbs shuddering the storm beaten sides of a Sinai. Blessed be they both! Each represents a moment of the ideal life ,each does us good. Our love is due to both.</item>
<item>Where words fail ,music speaks.</item>
<item>A lot of pop music is about stealing pocket money from children.</item>
<item>Music is the universal language it is the same anywhere you go in the world.</item>
<item>What we play is life.</item>
<item>There is two kinds of music the good and bad. I play the good kind.</item>
<item>Today ,music heralds  the establishment of a society of repetition in which nothing will happen anymore.</item>
<item>A verbal art like poetry is reflective it stops to think. Music is immediate ,it goes on to become.</item>
<item>Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.</item>
<item>I wish Frank Sinatra would just shut up and sing.</item>
<item>I have always kept one end in view ,namely    to conduct a well regulated church music to the honour of God.</item>
<item>Music is an agreeable harmony for the honor of God and the permissible delights of the soul.</item>
<item>There are two golden rules for an orchestra start together and finish together. The public doesnt give a damn what goes on in between.</item>
<item>The English may not like music ,but they absolutely love the noise it makes.</item>
<item>Great music is that which penetrates the ear with facility and leaves the memory with difficulty. Magical music never leaves the memory.</item>
<item>A musicologist is a man who can read music but cannot hear it.</item>
<item>This world is not a platform where you will hear Thalberg piano playing. It is a piano manufactory ,where are dust and shavings and boards ,and saws and files and rasps and sandpapers. The perfect instrument and the music will be hereafter.</item>
<item>She was one of those people who said I dont know anything about music ,but I know what I like.</item>
<item>Beethoven can write music ,thank God ,but he can do nothing else on earth.</item>
<item>Music is the mediator between the spiritual and the sensual life.</item>
<item>Music should strike fire from the heart of man ,and bring tears form the eyes of woman.</item>
<item>What will be the judgment a century hence concerning the lorded works of our favorite composers today? Inasmuch as nearly everything is subject to the changes of time ,and mores the pity the fashions of time ,only that which is good and true will endure like a rock and no wanton hand will ever venture to defile it. Then ,let every man do that which is right ,strive with all his might towards the goal which can never be obtained ,develop to the last breath the gifts with which the gracious Creator has endowed him ,and never cease to learn. For life is short ,art eternal.</item>
<item>I think it is time we learned the lesson of our century that the progress of the human spirit must keep pace with technological and scientific progress ,or that spirit will die. It is incumbent on our educators to remember this and music is at the top of the spiritual must list. When the study of the arts leads to the adoration of the formula heaven forbid  ,  we shall be lost. But as long as we insist on maintaining artistic vitality ,we are able to hope in man</item>

<item>Men may change their climate ,but they cannot change their nature. A man that goes out a fool cannot ride or sail himself into common sense.</item>
<item>I am at two with nature.</item>
<item>Nature has been for me ,for as long as I remember ,a source of solace ,inspiration ,adventure ,and delight a home ,a teacher ,a companion.</item>
<item>Nature has no mercy at all. Nature says ,I m going to snow. If you have on a bikini and no snowshoes ,that s tough. I am going to snow anyway.</item>
<item>The plastic virtues purity ,unity ,and truth ,keep nature in subjection.</item>
<item>All men by nature desire to know.</item>
<item>Nature does nothing uselessly.</item>
<item>To sit in the shade on a fine day ,and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment.</item>
<item>The subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of the senses and understanding.</item>
<item>Nature is commanded by obeying her.</item>
<item>This is the foundation of all. We are not to imagine or suppose ,but to discover ,what nature does or may be made to do.</item>
<item>Art is man s nature Nature is God s art.</item>
<item>Disease is the retribution of outraged Nature.</item>
<item>As a profession advertising is young as a force it is as old as the world. The first four words ever uttered ,Let there be light ,constitute its charter. All nature is vibrant with its impulse.</item>
<item>Nature  is nothing but the inner voice of self interest.</item>
<item>Nature always tends to act in the simplest way.</item>
<item>I look upon all creatures equally none are less dear to me and none more dear. But those who worship me with love live in me ,and I come to life in them.</item>
<item>The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the way. Some see nature all ridicule and deformity  and some scarce see nature at all. But to the eyes of the man of imagination ,nature is imagination itself.</item>
<item>You can t be suspicious of a tree ,or accuse a bird or squirrel of subversion or challenge the ideology of a violet.</item>
<item>Man masters nature not by force but by understanding. This is why science has succeeded where magic failed because it has looked for no spell to cast over nature.</item>
<item>All things are artificial ,for nature is the art of God.</item>
<item>To him who ,in the love of Nature ,holds Communion with her visible forms ,she speaks A various language.</item>
<item>The only way to spend New Year s Eve is either quietly with friends or in a brothel. Otherwise when the evening ends and people pair off ,someone is bound to be left in tears.</item>
<item>Then sing ,young hearts that are full of cheer ,with never a thought of sorrow the old goes out ,but the glad young year comes merrily in tomorrow.</item>
<item>Every New Year is the direct descendant ,isn t it ,of a long line of proven criminals? </item>
<item>Each age has deemed the new born year the fittest time for festal cheer.</item>
<item>To understand your parents love you must raise children yourself.</item>
<item>You must not expect old heads upon young shoulders.</item>
<item>He that does not bring up his son to some honest calling and employment ,brings him up to be a thief.</item>
<item>Maternity is a matter of fact ,paternity is a matter of opinion.</item>
<item>The unjustifiable severity of a parent is loaded with this aggravation ,that those whom he injures are always in his sight.</item>
<item>It s a sad moment ,really ,when parents first become a bit frightened of their children.</item>
<item>Anyone who has a child today should train him to be either a physicist or a ballet dancer. Then he ll escape.</item>
<item>The joys of parents are secret ,and so are their grieves and fears.</item>
<item>It s frightening to think that you mark your children merely by being yourself. It seems unfair. You can t assume the responsibility for everything you do or don t do.</item>
<item>Let me go to hell ,that s all I ask ,and go on cursing them there ,and them look down and hear me ,that might take some of the shine off their bliss.</item>
<item>We never know the love of the parent till we become parents ourselves.</item>
<item>He that curseth his father ,or his mother ,shall surely be put to death. Exodus 21 17 </item>
<item>To bring up a child in the way he should go travel that way yourself.</item>
<item>I don t know any parents that look into the eyes of a newborn baby and say ,How can we screw this kid up.</item>
<item>The first and finest lesson that parents can teach their children is faith and courage.</item>
<item>Fathers and mothers have lost the idea that the highest aspiration they might have for their children is for them to be wise  specialized competence and success are all that they can imagine.</item>
<item>I take a very practical view of raising children. I put a sign in each of their rooms Checkout Time is 18 years </item>
<item>When I was a young man ,I didn t think about having a family. My wife and I were too poor to have babies. Then all of a sudden ,one came along and scared the hell out of us because we had no money. Once the baby arrives ,you make do somehow. You fall in love with the baby and life adjusts itself. You find you don t need as much money as you thought. When that happens ,you can ask the questions that should have come before the baby.</item>
<item>Live so that when your children think of fairness and integrity ,they think of you.</item>
<item>You have to love your children unselfishly. That is hard. But it is the only way.</item>
<item>The greatest gift a parent can give a child is unconditional love. As a child wanders and strays ,finding his bearings ,he needs a sense of absolute love from a parent. There s nothing wrong with tough love ,as long as the love is unconditional.</item>
<item>Parents are the last people on earth who ought to have children.</item>
<item>We ,perhaps ,have corrupted our children and our grandchildren by heedless affluence ,by a lack of manliness ,by giving the younger generation more money and liberty than their youth can handle ,by indoctrinating them with sinister ideologies and false values ,by permitting them ,as young children ,to indulge themselves in imprudence to superiors and defiance of duly constituted authority ,by lack of prudent ,swift punishment when the transgressed ,by coddling and pampering them when they were children and protecting them from a very dangerous world </item>
<item>Good breeding differs ,if at all ,from high breeding only as it gracefully remembers the rights of others ,rather than gracefully insists on its own rights.</item>

<item>Patience is the key to paradise.</item>
<item>Patience is passion tamed.</item>
<item>Our real blessings often appear to us in the shape of pains ,losses and disappointments but let us have patience and we soon shall see them in their proper figures.</item>
<item>Slow and steady wins the race.</item>
<item>Waiting is a trap. There will always be reasons to wait The truth is ,there are only two things in life ,reasons and results ,and reasons simply dont count.</item>
<item>With close lipped Patience for our only friend ,Sad Patience ,too near neighbor to Despair.</item>
<item>Perhaps there is only one cardinal sin impatience. Because of impatience we were driven out of Paradise ,because of impatience we cannot return.</item>
<item>Who ever is out of patience is out of possession of their soul.</item>
<item>Beware of undertaking too much at the start. Be content with quite a little. Allow for accidents. Allow for human nature ,especially your own.</item>
<item>The lord is wonderfully good to those who wait for him and seek him.</item>
<item>Patience ,n. A minor form of dispair ,disguised as a virtue.</item>
<item>Nature thrives on patience man on impatience.</item>
<item>Inaction may be the biggest form of action.</item>
<item>There is no road too long to the man who advances deliberately and without undue haste there are no honors too distant to the man who prepares himself for them with patience.</item>
<item>Never think that God s delays are God s denials. Hold on Hold fast Hold out. Patience is genius.</item>
<item>Patience is not active on the contrary ,it is active it is concentrated strength.</item>
<item>Our patience will achieve more than our force.</item>
<item>It is not necessary for all men to be great in action. The greatest and sublimest power is often simple patience.</item>
<item>The hand that rocks the cradle rules the nation and its destiny.</item>
<item>A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government.</item>
<item>What pity is it That we can die ,but once to serve our country.</item>
<item>It is the patriotic duty of every man to lie for his country.</item>
<item>Love of country is like love of woman he loves her best who seeks to bestow on her the highest good.</item>
<item>It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country ,but rather for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens.</item>
<item>I love America more than any other country in this world ,and ,exactly for this reason ,I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.</item>
<item>True patriots we for be it understood we left our country for our country s good.</item>
<item>Patriotism. Combustible rubbish ready to the torch of any one ambitious to illuminate his name.</item>
<item>Patriotism must be founded on great principals and supported by great virtue.</item>
<item>Who saves his country violates no law.</item>
<item>Next to the love of God ,the love of country is the best preventive of crime.</item>
<item>Patriotism consists not in waving the flag ,but in striving that our country shall be righteous as well as strong.</item>
<item>God and Country are an unbeatable team they break all records for oppression and bloodshed.</item>
<item>To make us love our country ,our country ought to be lovely.</item>
<item>Though I love my country ,I do not love my countrymen.</item>
<item>The love of one </item>
<item>I am thankful to have had these ten weeks of quiet to get ready. Now I have had them and have been kindly treated here. I expected my sentence and I believe it was just. Standing as I do in view of God and Eternity ,I realise that patriotism is not enough ,I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.</item>
<item>My country wrong or right ,is like saying my mother ,drunk or sober.</item>
<item>My country ,right or wrong is a thing that no patriot would think of saying except in a desperate case. It is like saying My mother ,drunk or sober.</item>
<item>Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.</item>
<item>Many a bum show has been saved by the flag.</item>
<item>Patriotism is easy to understand in America it means looking out for yourself by looking out for your country.</item>
<item>A man s country is not a certain area of land ,of mountains ,rivers ,and woods ,but it is a principle and patriotism is loyalty to that principle.</item>
<item>The love of their country is with them only a mode of flattering its master as soon as they think that master can no longer hear ,they speak of everything with a frankness which is the more startling because those who listen to it become responsible.</item>
<item> If you wish for peace be ready for war.</item>
<item>When we can t find peace in ourselves it is vain to look for it elsewhere.</item>
<item>Nonviolence is the supreme law of life.</item>
<item>Peace with a club in hand is war.</item>
<item>If a man would live in peace he should be blind ,deaf ,and dumb.</item>
<item>Harmony is one phase of the law whose spiritual expression is love.</item>
<item>Bullets cannot be recalled. They cannot be uninvented. But they can be taken out of the gun.</item>
<item>Right human relations is the only true peace.</item>
<item>If the history of the past fifty years teaches us anything ,it is that peace does not follow disarmament disarmament follows peace.</item>
<item>They shall beat their swords into plowshares ,and their spears into pruning hooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation ,neither shall they learn war any more. Isaiah 2 4 </item>
<item>Seek peace ,and pursue it. Proverbs 34 14 </item>
<item>The peace makers shall be called the children of God.</item>
<item>Think not I came to send peace on the earth I came not to send peace but a sword.</item>
<item>Those who love thy law have great peace ,and nothing causes them to stumble. Psalms 119 165 </item>
<item>When a person s ways please the Lord ,he makes even his enemies to be at peace with them.</item>
<item>Peace ,in international affairs ,is a period of cheating between two periods of fighting.</item>
<item>If they want peace ,nations should avoid the pin pricks that precede cannon shots.</item>
<item>One cannot subdue a man by holding back his hands. Lasting peace comes not from force.</item>
<item>When you re finally up on the moon ,looking back at the earth ,all these differences and nationalistic traits are pretty well going to blend and you re going to get a concept that maybe this is really one world and why the hell can t we learn to live together like decent people? </item>
<item>We ve learned how to destroy ,but not to create how to waste ,but not to build how to kill men ,but not how to save them how to die ,but seldom how to live.</item>
<item>In truth ,to attain to interior peace ,one must be willing to pass through the contrary to peace. Such is the teaching of the Sages.</item>
<item>Don t tell me peace has broken out.</item>
<item>All that a pacifist can undertake but it is a very great deal is to refuse to kill ,injure or otherwise cause suffering to another human creature ,and untiringly to order his life by the rule of love though others may be captured by hate.</item>
<item>Why can t peace be a single overriding common purpose why do we wait for a crisis to pull us together? Let s pull together for peace.</item>
<item> He insulted me ,he cheated me ,he beat me ,he robbed me those who are free of resentful thoughts surely find peace.</item>
<item>A poet is someone who is astonished by everything.</item>
<item>I don t see how poetry can ever be easy  Real poetry ,the thick ,dense ,intense ,complicated stuff that lives and endures ,requires blood sweat blood and sweat are essential elements in poetry as well as behind it.</item>
<item>A poem records emotions and moods that lie beyond normal language ,that can only be patched together and hinted at metaphorically.</item>
<item>Poetry is finer and more philosophical than history for poetry expresses the universal ,and history only the particular.</item>
<item>Homer has taught all other poets the are of telling lies skillfully.</item>
<item>Written poetry is worth reading once ,and then should be destroyed. Let the dead poets make way for others. Then we might even come to see that it is our veneration for what has already been created ,however beautiful and valid it may be ,that petrifies us.</item>
<item>There is the view that poetry should improve your life. I think people confuse it with the Salvation Army.</item>
<item>It takes most men five years to recover from a college education ,and to learn that poetry is as vital to thinking as knowledge.</item>
<item>I cannot accept the doctrine that in poetry there is a suspension of belief. A poet must never make a statement simply because it is sounds poetically exciting he must also believe it to be true.</item>
<item>It is a sad fact about our culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art than he can by practicing it.</item>
<item>Poetry makes nothing happen. It survives in the valley of its saying.</item>
<item>Rhymes ,meters ,stanza forms ,etc. ,are like servants. If the master is fair enough to win their affection and firm enough to command their respect ,the result is an orderly happy household. If he is too tyrannical ,they give notice if he lacks authority ,they become slovenly ,impertinent ,drunk and dishonest.</item>
<item>As a poet there is only one political duty ,and that is to defend one s language against corruption. When it is corrupted ,people lose faith in what they hear and this leads to violence.</item>
<item>The poets did well to conjoin music and medicine ,because the office of medicine is but to tune the curious harp of man s body.</item>
<item>I gave up on new poetry myself thirty years ago ,when most of it began to read like coded messages passing between lonely aliens on a hostile world.</item>
<item>I ve read some of your modern free verse and wonder who set it free.</item>
<item>Who among us has not ,in moments of ambition ,dreamt of the miracle of a form of poetic prose ,musical but without rhythm and rhyme ,both supple and staccato enough to adapt itself to the lyrical movements of our souls ,the undulating movements of our reveries ,and the convulsive movements of our consciences? This obsessive ideal springs above all from frequent contact with enormous cities ,from the junction of their innumerable connections.</item>
<item>Poetry and progress are like two ambitious men who hate one another with an instinctive hatred ,and when they meet upon the same road ,one of them has to give place.</item>
<item>Any healthy man can go without food for two days but not without poetry.</item>
<item>The poet is like the prince of clouds Who haunts the tempest and laughs at the archer Exiled on the ground in the midst of jeers,His giant wings prevent him from walking.</item>
<item>The fact that there are so many weak ,poor and boring stories and novels written and published in America has been ascribed by our rebels to the horrible squareness of our institutions ,the idiocy of power ,the debasement of sexual instincts ,and the failure of writers to be alienated enough. The poems and novels of these same rebellious spirits ,and their theoretical statements ,are grimy and gritty and very boring too ,besides being nonsensical ,and it is evident by now that polymorphous sexuality and vehement declarations of alienation are not going to produce great works of art either.</item>
<item>People cannot stand the saddest truth I know about the very nature of reading and writing imaginative literature ,which is that poetry does not teach us how to talk to other people it teaches us how to talk to ourselves. What I </item>
<item>Poetry is the impish attempt to paint the color of the wind.</item>
<item>In the works of the better poets you get the sensation that they re not talking to people any more ,or to some seraphical creature. What they re doing is simply talking back to the language itself as beauty ,sensuality ,wisdom ,irony those aspects of language of which the poet is a clear mirror. Poetry is not an art or a branch of art ,it s something more. If what distinguishes us from other species is speech ,then poetry ,which is the supreme linguistic operation ,is our anthropological ,indeed genetic ,goal. Anyone who regards poetry as an entertainment ,as a read ,commits an anthropological crime ,in the first place ,against himself.</item>
<item>If a poet has any obligation toward society ,it is to write well. Being in the minority ,he has no other choice. Failing this duty ,he sinks into oblivion. Society ,on the other hand ,has no obligation toward the poet. A majority by definition ,society thinks of itself as having other options than reading verses ,no matter how well written. Its failure to do so results in its sinking to that level of locution at which society falls easy prey to a demagogue or a tyrant. This is society s own equivalent of oblivion.</item>
<item>To succeed in politics ,it is often necessary to rise above your principles.</item>
<item>Definition of Politics Poli in latin meaning many and tics meaning blood sucking parasites.</item>
<item>Politics ,as a practice ,whatever its professions ,has always been the systematic organization of hatreds.</item>
<item>Practical politics consists in ignoring facts.</item>
<item>Modern politics is ,at bottom ,a struggle not of men but of forces. The men become every year more and more creatures of force ,massed about central powerhouses. The conflict is no longer between the men ,but between the motors that drive the men ,and the men tend to succumb to their own motive forces.</item>
<item>In politics the middle way is none at all.</item>
<item>Politics is the gentle art of getting votes from the poor and campaign funds from the rich by promising to protect each from the other.</item>
<item>Growing older ,I have lost the need to be political ,which means ,in this country ,the need to be left. I am driven into grudging toleration of the Conservative Party because it is the party of non politics ,of resistance to politics.</item>
<item>The incestuous relationship between government and big business thrives in the dark.</item>
<item>The only way you can do that Balance The Budget ,Decrease Taxes ,and Increase Military Spending is with mirrors ,and that s what it would take.</item>

<item>All political parties die at last of swallowing their own lies.</item>
<item>Therefore ,the good of man must be the end of the science of politics.</item>
<item>What the statesman is most anxious to produce is a certain moral character in his fellow citizens ,namely a disposition to virtue and the performance of virtuous actions.</item>
<item>Politics will sooner or later make fools of everybody.</item>
<item>The biggest problem with politics or running for the governor </item>
<item>He could not see a belt without hitting below it.</item>
<item>The belief that politics can be scientific must inevitably produce tyrannies. Politics cannot be a science ,because in politics theory and practice cannot be separated ,and the sciences depend upon their separation. Empirical politics must be kept in bounds by democratic institutions ,which leave it up to the subjects of the experiment to say whether it shall be tried ,and to stop it if they dislike it ,because ,in politics ,there is a distinction ,unknown to science ,between Truth and Justice.</item>
<item>My deepest feeling about politicians is that they are dangerous lunatics to be avoided when possible and carefully humored people ,above all ,to whom one must never tell the truth.</item>
<item>It is as hard and severe a thing to be a true politician as to be truly moral.</item>
<item>The apparent rulers of the English nation are like the imposing personages of a splendid procession it is by them the mob are influenced it is they whom the spectators cheer. The real rulers are secreted in second rate carriages no one cares for them or asks after them ,but they are obeyed implicitly and unconsciously by reason of the splendor of those who eclipsed and preceded them.</item>
<item>A constitutional statesman is in general a man of common opinions and uncommon abilities.</item>
<item>When great questions end ,little parties begin.</item>
<item>Every political system is an accumulation of habits ,customs ,prejudices ,and principles that have survived a long process of trial and error and of ceaseless response to changing circumstances. If the system works well on the whole ,it is a lucky accident the luckiest ,indeed ,that can befall a society.</item>

<item>Be brave enough to live creatively. The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. You cannot get there by bus ,only by hard work ,risking and by not quite knowing what you are doing. What you will discover will be wonderful yourself.</item>

<item>Now the Name of Jesus is a concrete and powerful means of transforming men and women into their hidden ,innermost utmost reality.</item>
<item>It is necessary therefore ,it is possible.</item>
<item>I ve never met a person ,I don t care what his condition ,in whom I could not see possibilities. I don t care how much a man may consider himself a failure ,I believe in him ,for he can change the thing that is wrong in his life any time he is ready and prepared to do it. Whenever he develops the desire ,he can take away from his life the thing that is defeating it. The capacity for reformation and change lies within.</item>
<item>Our sun is one of 100 billion stars in our galaxy. Our galaxy is one of billions of galaxies populating the universe. It would be the height of presumption to think that we are the only living beings in that enormous immensity.</item>
<item>Life has no limitations ,except the ones you make.</item>
<item>The only limits to the possibilities in your life tomorrow are the buts you use today.</item>
<item>If you put yourself in a position where you have to stretch outside your comfort zone ,then you are forced to expand your consciousness.</item>
<item>The things you want are always possible it is just that the way to get them is not always apparent. The only real obstacle in your path to a fulfilling life is you ,and that can be a considerable obstacle because you carry the baggage of insecurities and past experience.</item>
<item>Rough diamonds may sometimes be mistaken for worthless pebbles.</item>
<item>Our aspirations are our possibilities.</item>
<item>Whatever your discipline ,become a student of excellence in all things. Take every opportunity to observe people who manifest the qualities of mastery. These models of excellence will inspire you and guide you toward the fulfillment of your highest potential.</item>
<item>Few men during their lifetime comes anywhere near exhausting the resources dwelling within them. There are deep wells of strength that are never used.</item>
<item>Set your sights high ,the higher the better. Expect the most wonderful things to happen ,not in the future but right now. Realize that nothing is to good. Allow absolutely nothing to hamper you or hold you up in any way.</item>

<item>He who pays the piper calls the tune.</item>
<item>Though men now possess the power to dominate and exploit every corner of the natural world ,nothing in that fact implies that they have the right or the need to do so.</item>
<item>Power corrupts ,and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</item>
<item>Arbitrary power is like most other things which are very hard ,very liable to be broken.</item>
<item>A friend in power is a friend lost.</item>
<item>Power always thinks it has a great soul and vast views beyond the comprehension of the weak.</item>
<item>The man whose authority is recent is always stern.</item>
<item>The price of power is responsibility for the public good.</item>
<item>Power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have.</item>
<item>Our duty is to be useful ,not according to our desires ,but according to our powers.</item>
<item>Power tires only those who do not have it.</item>
<item>A word after a word after a word is power.</item>
<item>If you are distressed by anything external ,the pain is not due to the thing itself but to your own estimate of it and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.</item>
<item>Nothing has such power to broaden the mind as the ability to investigate systematically and truly all that comes under thy observation in life.</item>
<item>Nothing destroys authority more than the unequal and untimely interchange of power stretched too far and relaxed too much.</item>
<item>It is a strange desire ,to seek power and lose liberty ,or to seek power over others and to lose power over a man s self. The rising unto place is laborious ,and by pains men come to greater pains ,and it is sometimes base and by indignities men come to dignities. The standing is slippery ,and the regress is either a downfall or at least an eclipse ,which is a melancholy thing.</item>
<item>But the relationship of morality and power is a very subtle one. Because ultimately power without morality is no longer power.</item>
<item>Power is not revealed by striking hard or often ,but by striking true.</item>

<item>A good name is better than precious ointment. Ecclesiastes 7 1 </item>
<item>It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that ,you ll do things differently.</item>
<item>To disregard what the world thinks of us is not only arrogant but utterly shameless.</item>
<item>There are two way of establishing a reputation ,one to be praised by honest people and the other to be accused by rogues. It is best ,however ,to secure the first one ,because it will always be accompanied by the latter.</item>
<item>The two most precious things this side of the grave are our reputation and our life. But it is to be lamented that the most contemptible whisper may deprive us of the one ,and the weakest weapon of the other.</item>
<item>I d like people to think of me as someone who cares about them.</item>
<item>Reputation is rarely proportioned to virtue.</item>
<item>Glass ,china ,and reputation are easily cracked ,and never mended well.</item>
<item>His reputation is what men say he is. That can be damaged but reputation is for time ,character is for eternity.</item>
<item>A reputation once broken may possibly be repaired ,but the world will always keep their eyes on the spot where the crack was.</item>
<item>Time goes by ,reputation increases ,ability declines.</item>
<item>The great difficulty is first to win a reputation the next to keep it while you live and the next to preserve it after you die ,when affection and interest are over ,and nothing but sterling excellence can preserve your name. Never suffer youth to be an excuse for inadequacy ,nor age and fame to be an excuse for indolence.</item>
<item>How many people live on the reputation of the reputation they might have made! </item>
<item>What people say behind your back is your standing in the community.</item>
<item>He that has the name to be an early riser may sleep till noon.</item>
<item>Good will ,like a good name ,is got by many actions ,and lost by one.</item>
<item>The blaze of reputation cannot be blown out ,but it often dies in the socket a very few names may be considered as perpetual lamps that shine unconsumed.</item>
<item>For God s sake I never was more serious don t make me ridiculous any more by terming me gentle hearted in print  substitute drunken dog ,ragged head ,seld shaven ,odd eyed ,stuttering ,or any other epithet which truly and properly belongs to the gentleman in question.</item>
<item>We would all like a reputation for generosity and we d all like to buy it cheap.</item>
<item>Kindly words do not enter so deeply into men as a reputation for kindness.</item>
<item>Until you ve lost your reputation ,you never realize what a burden it was.</item>
<item>If I take care of my character ,my reputation will take care of me.</item>
<item>It is generally much more shameful to lose a good reputation than never to have acquired it.</item>

<item>The question before the human race is ,whether the God of nature shall govern the world by his own laws ,or whether priests and kings shall rule it by fictitious miracles.</item>
<item>Here is everything which can lay hold of the eye ,ear and imagination everything which can charm and bewitch the simple and ignorant. I wonder how Luther ever broke the spell.</item>
<item>The first time I sang in the church choir two hundred people changed their religion.</item>
<item>What is a cult? It just means not enough people to make a minority.</item>
<item>He was of the faith chiefly in the sense that the church he currently did not attend was Catholic.</item>
<item>The theologian considers sin mainly as an offence against God the moral philosopher as contrary to reasonableness.</item>
<item>Of all possible sexual perversions ,religion is the only one to have ever been scientifically systematized.</item>
<item>The true meaning of religion is thus ,not simply morality ,but morality touched by emotion.</item>
<item>Bernard always had a few prayers in the hall and some whiskey afterwards as he was rather pious.</item>
<item>I have no objections to churches so long as they do not interfere with God s work.</item>
<item>Dogmatic theological statements are neither logical propositions nor poetic utterances. They are shaggy dog stories they have a point ,but he who tries too hard to get it will miss it.</item>
<item>It is indolence  Indolence and love of ease a want of all laudable ambition ,of taste for good company ,or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable ,which make men clergymen. A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish read the newspaper ,watch the weather ,and quarrel with his wife. His curate does all the work and the business of his own life is to dine.</item>
<item>It will ,I believe ,be everywhere found ,that as the clergy are ,or are not what they ought to be ,so are the rest of the nation.</item>
<item>The first revolt is against the supreme tyranny of theology ,of the phantom of God. As long as we have a master in heaven ,we will be slaves on earth.</item>
<item>Our religion is itself profoundly sad a religion of universal anguish ,and one which ,because of its very catholicity ,grants full liberty to the individual and asks no better than to be celebrated in each man s own language so long as he knows anguish and is a painter.</item>
<item>Theology is a science of mind applied to God.</item>
<item>Theology is but our ideas of truth classified and arranged.</item>
<item>The Church is not a gallery for the exhibition of eminent Christians ,but a school for the education of imperfect ones.</item>
<item>As a man can drink water from any side of a full tank ,so the skilled theologian can wrest from any scripture that which will serve his purpose.</item>
<item>The Lord is my light ,and my salvation whom shall I fear? </item>
<item>Respect for ones parents is the highest duty of civil life.</item>
<item>If you steal something small you are a petty thief ,but if you steal millions you are a gentleman of society.</item>
<item>Respect starts with yourself.</item>
<item>Fools take to themselves the respect that is given to their office.</item>
<item>To depersonalize man is the dominant drift of our times.</item>
<item>There is no respect for others without humility in one s self.</item>
<item>People who treat other people as less than human must not be surprised when the bread they have cast on the waters comes floating back to them ,poisoned.</item>
<item>Impiety. Your irreverence toward my deity.</item>
<item>The inquiry in England is not whether a man has talents and genius ,but whether he is passive and polite and a virtuous ass and obedient to noblemen s opinions in art and science. If he is ,he is a good man. If not ,he must be starved.</item>
<item>Respect the burden.</item>
<item>A celebrated people lose dignity upon a closer view.</item>
<item>Conventionality is not morality. Self righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns.</item>
<item>Respect is love in plain clothes.</item>
<item>Nothing is more despicable than respect based on fear.</item>
<item>Eminence without merit earns deference without esteem.</item>
<item>Respect commands itself and it can neither be given nor withheld when it is due.</item>
<item>Without feelings of respect ,what is there to distinguish men from beasts? </item>
<item>Decency must be an even more exhausting state to maintain than its opposite. Those who succeed seem to need a stupefying amount of sleep.</item>
<item>In order to acquire a growing and lasting respect in society ,it is a good thing ,if you possess great talent ,to give ,early in your youth ,a very hard kick to the right shin of the society that you love. After that ,be a snob.</item>
<item>I get no respect. The way my luck is running ,if I was a politician I would be honest.</item>
<item>Men are respectable only as they respect.</item>
<item>Impudence is the worst of all human diseases.</item>
<item>If you have some respect for people as they are ,you can be more effective in helping them to become better than they are.</item>
<item>I am in earnest I will not equivocate I will not excuse I will not retreat a single inch and I will be heard! </item>
<item>The respect of those you respect is worth more than the applause of the multitude.</item>
<item>To say the word Romanticism is to say modern art that is ,intimacy ,spirituality ,color ,aspiration towards the infinite ,expressed by every means available to the arts.</item>
<item>The essence of romantic love is that wonderful beginning ,after which sadness and impossibility may become the rule.</item>
<item>Romanticism is not just a mode it literally eats into every life. Women will never get rid of just waiting for the right man.</item>
<item>No age seemed the age of romance to itself.</item>
<item>Love stories are only fit for the solace of people in the insanity of puberty. No healthy adult human being can really care whether so and so does or does not succeed in satisfying his physiological uneasiness by the aid of some particular person or not.</item>
<item>Romance like a ghost escapes touching it is always where you are not ,not where you are. The interview or conversation was prose at the time ,but it is poetry in the memory.</item>
<item>Romance has been elegantly defined as the offspring of fiction and love.</item>
<item>I m a romantic a sentimental person thinks things will last a romantic person hopes against hope that they won t.</item>
<item>Rather would I have the love songs of romantic ages ,rather Don Juan and Madame Venus ,rather an elopement by ladder and rope on a moonlight night ,followed by the father s curse ,mother s moans ,and the moral comments of neighbors ,than correctness and propriety measured by yardsticks.</item>
<item>She who makes her husband and her children happy ,who reclaims the one from vice ,and trains up the other to virtue ,is a much greater character than the ladies described in romance ,whose whole occupation is to murder mankind with shafts from their quiver or their eyes.</item>
<item>Romance and novel paint beauty in colors more charming than nature ,and describe a happiness that humans never taste. How deceptive and destructive are those pictures of consummate bliss! </item>
<item>Romance ,like the rabbit at the dog track ,is the elusive ,fake ,and never attained reward which ,for the benefit and amusement of our masters ,keeps us running and thinking in safe circles.</item>
<item>And what s romance? Usually ,a nice little tale where you have everything As You Like It ,where rain never wets your jacket and gnats never bite your nose and it s always daisy time.</item>
<item>The concept of romantic love affords a means of emotional manipulation which the male is free to exploit ,since love is the only circumstance in which the female is ideologically pardoned for sexual activity.</item>
<item>Writers of novels and romance in general bring a double loss to their readers robbing them of their time and money representing men ,manners ,and things ,that never have been ,or are likely to be.</item>
<item>Any walk through a park that runs between a double line of mangy trees and passes brazenly by the ladies toilet is invariably known as Lover s Lane.</item>
<item>I m a romantic a sentimental person thinks things will last a romantic person hopes against hope that they won t.</item>
<item>Marriage is a romance in which the hero dies in the first chapter.</item>
<item>What s the difference between the music of my generation and today s. Our songs were about Love and Romance ,today s music is chiefly about sex which I might add gets a little boring.</item>
<item>To love oneself is the beginning of a life long romance.</item>
<item>Romance should never begin with sentiment. It should begin with science and end with a settlement.</item>
<item>He must have a truly romantic nature ,for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about.</item>
<item>Nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humor in the woman.</item>
<item>When one is in love ,one always begins by deceiving one s self ,and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.</item>
<item>Melancholy is at the bottom of everything ,just as at the end of all rivers is the sea. Can it be otherwise in a world where nothing lasts ,where all that we have loved or shall love must die? Is death ,then ,the secret of life? The gloom of an eternal mourning enwraps ,more or less closely ,every serious and thoughtful soul ,as night enwraps the universe.</item>
<item>Possibly the worst break up line ever it s not me ,it s you.</item>
<item>Nothing is funnier than unhappiness ,I grant you that. Yes ,yes ,it s the most comical thing in the world.</item>
<item>Sorrow is better than laughter ,for by the sadness of the face the heart is made better.</item>
<item>Joys impregnate. Sorrows bring forth.</item>
<item>Some say that happiness is not good for mortals ,and they ought to be answered that sorrow is not fit for immortals and is utterly useless to any one a blight never does good to a tree ,and if a blight kill not a tree but it still bear fruit ,let none say that the fruit was in consequence of the blight.</item>
<item>Excessive sorrow laughs. Excessive joy weeps.</item>
<item>There are seeds of self destruction in all of us that will bear only unhappiness if allowed to grow.</item>
<item>Let no one till his death be called unhappy. Measure not the work until the day s out and the labor done.</item>
<item>We tell our triumphs to the crowds ,but our own hearts are the sole confidants of our sorrows.</item>
<item>Had we never lov d sae kindly ,Had we never lov d sae blindly ,Never met or never parted we had never been broken hearted.</item>
<item>The busy have no time for tears.</item>
<item>Sorrow is knowledge ,those that know the most must mourn the deepest ,the tree of knowledge is not the tree of life.</item>
<item>It is sad and wrong to be so dependent for the life of my life on any human being as I am on you but I cannot by any force of logic cure myself at this date ,when it has become second nature.</item>
<item>Man s unhappiness ,as I construe ,comes of his greatness it is because there is an Infinite in him ,which with all his cunning he cannot quite bury under the Finite.</item>
<item>Never believe straight off in a man s unhappiness. Ask him if he can still sleep. If the answer s yes ,all s well. That is enough.</item>
<item>It is foolish to tear one s hair in grief ,as though sorrow would be made less with baldness.</item>
<item>There is pleasure in calm remembrance of a past sorrow.</item>
<item>And almost everyone when age ,disease ,or sorrows strike him ,inclines to think there is a God ,or something very like him.</item>
<item>We should feel sorrow ,but not sink under its oppression.</item>
<item>The path of sorrow and that path alone ,leads to a land where sorrow is unknown.</item>
<item>Unhappiness is best defined as the difference between our talents and our expectations.</item>
<item>To fight aloud is very brave ,but gallanter ,I know ,who charge within the bosom ,the Cavalry of Woe.</item>
<item>Man could not live if he were entirely impervious to sadness. Many sorrows can be endured only by being embraced ,and the pleasure taken in them naturally has a somewhat melancholy character.</item>
<item>Sadness does not inhere in things it does not reach us from the world and through mere contemplation of the world. It is a product of our own thought. We create it out of whole cloth.</item>
<item>Sex is like snow you never know how many inches you are going to get or how long it is going to last.</item>
<item>The Englishman can get along with sex quite perfectly so long as he can pretend that it isn t sex but something else.</item>
<item>Sex without love is a meaningless experience ,but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good.</item>
<item>Sex is the most fun you can have without laughing.</item>
<item>A Bay Area Bisexual told me I didn t quite coincide with either of her desires.</item>
<item>You have to see the sex act comically ,as a child.</item>
<item>Any idiot can get laid when they re famous. That s easy. It s getting laid when you re not famous that takes some talent.</item>
<item>Sex </item>
<item>The question of sexual dominance can exist only in the nightmare of that soul which has armed itself ,totally ,against the possibility of the changing motion of conquest and surrender ,which is love.</item>
<item>The American ideal of sexuality appears to be rooted in the American ideal of masculinity. This idea has created cowboys and Indians ,good guys and bad guys ,punks and studs ,tough guys and softies ,butch and faggot ,black and white. It is an ideal so paralytically infantile that it is virtually forbidden as an unpatriotic act that the American boy evolve into the complexity of manhood.</item>
<item>I believe that organic sex ,body against body ,skin area against skin area ,is becoming no longer possible ,simply because if anything is to have any meaning for us it must take place in terms of the values and experiences of the media landscape. What we re getting is a whole new order of sexual fantasies ,involving a different order of experiences ,like car crashes ,like travelling in jet aircraft ,the whole overlay of new technologies ,architecture ,interior design ,communications ,transport ,merchandising. These things are beginning to reach into our lives and change the interior design of our sexual fantasies. We ve got to recognize that what one sees through the window of the TV screen is as important as what one sees through a window on the street.</item>
<item>I ve tried several varieties of sex. The conventional position makes me claustrophobic and the others give me a stiff neck or lockjaw.</item>
<item>Sex the thing that takes up the least amount of time and causes the most amount of trouble.</item>
<item>Eroticism is assenting to life even in death.</item>
<item>Sex pleasure in woman is a kind of magic spell it demands complete abandon if words or movements oppose the magic of caresses ,the spell is broken.</item>
<item>Because her instinct has told her ,or because she has been reliably informed ,the faded virgin knows that the supreme joys are not for her she knows by a process of the intellect but she can feel her deprivation no more than the young mother can feel the hardship of the virgin s lot.</item>
<item>I may not be a great actress but I ve become the greatest at screen orgasms. Ten seconds of heavy breathing ,roll your head from side to side ,simulate a slight asthma attack and die a little.</item>
<item>Sexual liberation ,as a slogan ,turns out to be another kind of bondage. For a woman it offers orgasm as her ultimate and major fulfillment it s better than motherhood.</item>
<item>An isolated outbreak of virginity is a rash on the face of society. It arouses only pity from the married ,and embarrassment from the single.</item>
<item>What comes first in a relationship is lust then more lust.</item>
<item>Embraces are cominglings from the head even to the feet ,and not a pompous high priest entering by a secret place.</item>
<item>For once you must try not to shirk the facts mankind is kept alive by bestial acts.</item>
<item>Men always fall for frigid women because they put on the best show.</item>
<item>And I wanted to cry out at her that I could not put the body apart from the soul ,and that the comfort of her body was more than a thing of the flesh ,but was also a comfort of the soul ,and why it was I could not say ,and why it should be ,I could not say ,but there was in it nothing that was ugly or evil ,but only good. But how can one find such words? </item>
<item>If the devil were to offer me a resurgence of what is commonly called virility ,I d decline. Just keep my liver and lungs in good working order ,I d reply ,so I can go on drinking and smoking! </item>
<item>Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it ,and I shall move the world.</item>
<item>Rather than have it the principal thing in my son s mind ,I would gladly have him think that the sun went round the earth ,and that the stars were so many spangles set in the bright blue firmament.</item>
<item>Science can be introduced to children well or poorly. If poorly ,children can be turned away from science they can develop a lifelong antipathy they will be in a far worse condition than if they had never been introduced to science at all.</item>
<item>Though science can cause problems ,it is not by ignorance that we will solve them.</item>
<item>There is a single light of science ,and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere.</item>
<item>When I find myself in the company of scientists ,I feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into a room full of dukes.</item>
<item>Science is but an image of the truth.</item>
<item>The events of human life ,whether public or private ,are so intimately linked to architecture that most observers can reconstruct nations or individuals in all the truth of their habits from the remains of their public monuments or from their domestic relics. Archaeology is to social nature what comparative anatomy is to organized nature. A mosaic reveals an entire society ,just as a skeleton of an ichthyosaur suggests an entire creation. Everything is deducible ,everything is linked. The cause allows one to guess the effect ,just as each effect allows one to reconstruct a cause. The scientist can resuscitate in this manner even the warts of ancient times. From this comes without doubt the prodigious interest that an architectural description can inspire when the writer s fantasy is faithful to its basic elements. Cannot each person reattach it to its past by rigorous deductions? And as for man ,does not the past singularly resemble the future? Tell him what was and is this not almost always the same thing as telling him what will be? </item>
<item>Whatever the scientists may say ,if we take the supernatural out of life ,we leave only the unnatural.</item>
<item>Not all chemicals are bad. Without chemicals such as hydrogen and oxygen ,for example ,there would be no way to make water ,a vital ingredient in beer.</item>
<item>The best theology would need no advocates it would prove itself.</item>
<item>The microbe is so very small You cannot take him out at all.</item>
<item>In science as in love ,too much concentration on technique can often lead to impotence.</item>
<item>My dear ,descended from the apes! Let us hope it is not true ,but if it is ,let us pray it will not become generally known.</item>
<item>If anybody says he can think about quantum physics without getting giddy ,that only shows he has not understood the first thing about them.</item>
<item>Art is meant to disturb. Science reassures.</item>
<item>Science knows only one commandment contribute to science.</item>
<item>That is the essence of science ask an impertinent question ,and you are on the way to a pertinent answer.</item>
<item>Dissent is the native activity of the scientist ,and it has got him into a good deal of trouble in the last years. But if that is cut off ,what is left will not be a scientist. And I doubt whether it will be a man.</item>
<item>It doesn t matter whether you re talking about bombs or the intelligence quotients of one race as against another if a man is a scientist ,like me ,he ll always say Publish and be damned.</item>
<item>No science is immune to the infection of politics and the corruption of power.</item>
<item>Science has nothing to be ashamed of even in the ruins of Nagasaki. The shame is theirs who appeal to other values than the human imaginative values which science has evolved.</item>
<item>The most remarkable discovery ever made by scientists was science itself.</item>
<item>Sometimes just a smile on our face can help to make this world a better place. Stand up for the things that are right. Try to talk things out instead of fight. Lend a hand when you can ,get involved this is good. You can help to make a difference in your neighborhood.</item>
<item>The rain may be falling hard outside ,But your smile makes it all alright. I m so gland that you re my friend. I know our friendship will never end.</item>
<item>If you have only one smile in you ,give it to the people you love. Don t be surly at home ,then go out in the street and start grinning Good morning at total strangers.</item>
<item>Smile and others will smile back. Smile to show how transparent ,how candid you are. Smile if you have nothing to say. Most of all ,do not hide the fact you have nothing to say nor your total indifference to others. Let this emptiness ,this profound indifference shine out spontaneously in your smile.</item>
<item>Something of a person s character may be observed by how they smile. Some never smile they only grin.</item>
<item>Thinking a smile all the time will keep your face youthful.</item>
<item>Smiles form the channel of a future tear.</item>
<item>She gave me a smile I could feel in my hip pocket.</item>
<item>We smile at the ignorance of the savage who cuts down the tree in order to reach its fruit but the same blunder is made by every person who is over eager and impatient in the pursuit of pleasure.</item>
<item>Most smiles are started by another smile.</item>
<item>A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.</item>
<item>Wear a smile and have friends wear a scowl and have wrinkles. What do we live for if not to make the world less difficult for each other? </item>
<item>Start off everyday with a simple smile and get it over with.</item>
<item>If you re not using your smile ,you re like a man with a million dollars in the bank and no checkbook.</item>
<item>Youth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms.</item>
<item>Smiles are the language of love.</item>
<item>Smile ,damn it !! Smile.</item>
<item>Smile ,it s free therapy.</item>
<item>Smile ,it s better than a poke in the eye.</item>
<item>If you haven t seen your wife smile at a traffic cop ,you haven t seen her smile her prettiest.</item>
<item>There are many kinds of smiles ,each having a distinct character. Some announce goodness and sweetness ,others betray sarcasm ,bitterness and pride some soften the countenance by their languishing tenderness ,others brighten by their spiritual vivacity.</item>
<item>Welcome every morning with a smile. Look on the new day as another special gift from your Creator ,another golden opportunity to complete what you were unable to finish yesterday. Be a self starter. Let your first hour set the theme of success and positive action that is certain to echo through your entire day. Today will never happen again. Don t waste it with a false start or no start at all. You were not born to fail.</item>
<item>Smile at each other ,smile at your wife ,smile at your husband ,smile at your children ,smile at each other it doesn t matter who it is and that will help you to grow up in greater love for each other.</item>
<item>The real man smiles in trouble ,gathers strength from distress ,and grows brave by reflection.</item>
<item>A smile cures the wounding of a frown.</item>
<item>Society is like a stew. If you don t stir it up every once in a while then a layer of scum floats to the top.</item>
<item>The danger is not that a particular class is unfit to govern. Every class is unfit to govern.</item>
<item>American society is a sort of flat ,fresh water pond which absorbs silently ,without reaction ,anything which is thrown into it.</item>
<item>The happiness of society is the end of government.</item>
<item>Society lives by faith ,and develops by science.</item>
<item>The problem with society is that happiness and intelligence are rarely found in the same person. I guess that s why they say ignorance is bliss.</item>
<item>Nor was civil society founded merely to preserve the lives of its members but that they might live well for otherwise a state might be composed of slaves ,or the animal creation... nor is it an alliance mutually to defend each other from injuries ,or for a commercial intercourse. But whosoever endeavors to establish wholesome laws in a state ,attends to the virtues and vices of each individual who composes it from whence it is evident ,that the first care of him who would found a city ,truly deserving that name ,and not nominally so ,must be to have his citizens virtuous.</item>
<item>The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.</item>
<item>Popular art is the dream of society it does not examine itself.</item>
<item>The whole history of civilization is strewn with creeds and institutions which were invaluable at first ,and deadly afterwards.</item>
<item>If you re treated a certain way you become a certain kind of person. If certain things are described to you as being real they re real for you whether they re real or not.</item>
<item>Society is held together by our need we bind it together with legend ,myth ,coercion ,fearing that without it we will be hurled into that void ,within which ,like the earth before the Word was spoken ,the foundations of society are hidden.</item>
<item>The bastard form of mass culture is humiliated repetition... always new books ,new programs ,new films ,news items ,but always the same meaning.</item>
<item>Society cares for the individual only so far as he is profitable.</item>
<item>Ours is the age of substitutes instead of language ,we have jargon instead of principles ,slogans and ,instead of genuine ideas ,bright ideas.</item>
<item>What is a wife and what is a harlot? What is a church and what is a theatre? are they two and not one? Can they exist separate? Are not religion and politics the same thing? Brotherhood is religion. O demonstrations of reason dividing families in cruelty and pride! </item>
<item>Self recognition is necessary to know one s road ,but ,knowing the road ,the price of the mistakes and perils is worth paying. The following of that road will be all the discipline one needs. Discipline does not mean being molded by outside forces ,but sticking to one s road against the forces that would deflect or bury the soul. People speak of finding one </item>
<item>Our true ancestry is the emergent creativity of the universe. Our forebears were the great inventors who learned how to coalesce hydrogen and helium into stars ,to form planets ,to sustain life first from mineral nutrients in the sea and later to capture delicious photons ,to exploit oxygen for energy rather than be exterminated by it ,to diversify via sexual reproduction ,to form social groups for greater security and protection of offspring. We are the beneficiaries and ,admittedly ,also the victims of this narrative of emergence. Our companions </item>
<item>I am now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society ,be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.</item>
<item>Society is indeed a contract. It is a partnership in all science a partnership in all art a partnership in every virtue ,and in all perfection. As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations ,it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living ,but between those who are living ,those who are dead ,and those who are to be born.</item>
<item>Society is now one polished horde ,formed of two mighty tribes ,the Bores and Bored.</item>
<item>It is a stern fact of history that no nation that rushed to the abyss ever turned back. Not ever ,in the long history of the world. We are now on the edge of the abyss. Can we ,for the first time in history ,turn back? It is up to you.</item>
<item>We call it a Society and go about professing openly the totalest separation ,isolation. Our life is not a mutual helpfulness but rather ,cloaked under due laws of war ,named fair competition and so forth ,it is a mutual hostility.</item>
<item>Society is composed of two great classes ,those that have more dinners than appetite ,and those who have more appetite than dinners.</item>
<item>Society is divided into two classes ,the shearers and the shorn.</item>
<item>Winners never quit and quitters never win.</item>
<item>Since the Bible and the church are obviously mistaken in telling us where we came from ,how can we trust them to tell us where we are going? </item>
<item>I strongly believe the black culture spends too much time ,energy and effort raising ,praising ,and teasing our black children about the dubious glories of professional sports.</item>
<item>There is a syndrome in sports called paralysis by analysis.</item>
<item>I run because it s my passion ,and not just a sport. Every time I walk out the door ,I know why I m going where I m going and I m already focused on that special place where I find my peace and solitude. Running ,to me ,is more than just a physical exercise... it s a consistent reward for victory! </item>
<item>There are people who think that wrestling is an ignoble sport. Wrestling is not sport ,it is a spectacle ,and it is no more ignoble to attend a wrestled performance of suffering than a performance of the sorrows of Arnolphe or Andromaque.</item>
<item>For man ,maximum excitement is the confrontation of death and the skillful defiance of it by watching others fed to it as he survives transfixed with rapture.</item>
<item>How many charming talents have been spoiled by the instilled desire to do important work! Some people are born to lift heavy weights. Some are born to juggle with golden balls.</item>
<item>Never let a win get to your head ,or a loss to your heart.</item>
<item>Athletes need freedom of excess  That is why we gave them this motto </item>
<item>So you wish to conquer in the Olympic games ,my friend? And I too ,by the Gods ,and a fine thing it would be! But first mark the conditions and the consequences ,and then set to work. You will have to put yourself under discipline to eat by rule ,to avoid cakes and sweetmeats to take exercise at the appointed hour whether you like it or no ,in cold and heat to abstain from cold drinks and from wine at your will in a word ,to give yourself over to the trainer as to a physician. Then in the conflict itself you are likely enough to dislocate your wrist or twist your ankle ,to swallow a great deal of dust ,or to be severely thrashed ,and ,after all these things ,to be defeated.</item>
<item>The first thing is to love your sport. Never do it to please someone else. It has to be yours.</item>
<item>In 1883 while I was working at the London Hospital I chanced to turn in to one of D. L. Moody s great tent meetings in the slums of East London. I was amazed to see on the platform with him several men whose athletic prowess was world famous. That was a credential to me that it was worth stopping to listen to what was going to be said. I still believe athletic success is an invaluable asset to a preacher. Christ ,I am sure ,wants football ,baseball ,and track team men in an age when theological expositions ,however deep and learned ,when orthodoxy ,conventionality ,or even correct vestments and ritual ,have so little attraction for the young men who will be leaders tomorrow.</item>
<item>The human spirit sublimatesthe impulses it thwarts a healthy sex life mitigates the lust for other sports.</item>
<item>If luck weren t involved ,I d win every tournament! </item>
<item>Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter s honor.</item>
<item>Unlike any other business in the United States ,sports must preserve an illusion of perfect innocence. The mounting of this illusion defines the purpose and accounts for the immense wealth of American sports. It is the ceremony of innocence that the fans pay to see not the game or the match or the bout ,but the ritual portrayal of a world in which time stops and all hope remains plausible ,in which everybody present can recover the blameless expectations of a child ,where the forces of light always triumph over the powers of darkness.</item>
<item>When we lose ,I eat. When we win ,I eat. I also eat when we re rained out.</item>
<item>Sports should always be fun.</item>
<item>In sports... you play from the time you re eight years old ,and then you re done forever.</item>
<item>Sport in the sense of a mass spectacle ,with death to add to the underlying excitement ,comes into existence when a population has been drilled and regimented and depressed to such an extent that it needs at least a vicarious participation in difficult feats of strength or skill or heroism in order to sustain its waning life sense.</item>
<item>People in the States used to think that if girls were good at sports their sexuality would be affected. Being feminine meant being a cheerleader ,not being an athlete. The image of women is changing now. You don t have to be pretty for people to come and see you play. At the same time ,if you re a good athlete ,it doesn t mean you re not a woman.</item>
<item>In sport ,mental imagery is used primarily to help you get the best out of yourself in training and competition. The developing athletes who make the fastest progress and those who ultimately become their best make extensive use of mental imagery. They use it daily as a means of directing what will happen in training ,and as a way of pre experiencing their best competition performances.</item>
<item>Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred ,jealousy ,boastfulness ,disregard of all rules ,and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence in other words it is war minus the shooting.</item>
<item>Sport inevitably creates deadness of feeling. No one could take pleasure in it who was sensitive to suffering and therefore its pursuit by women is much more to be regretted than its pursuit by men ,because women pursue much more violently and recklessly what they pursue at all.</item>
<item>Fortitude is the marshal of thought ,the armor of the will ,and the fort of reason.</item>
<item>Strength instead of being the lusty child of passion ,grows by grappling with and subduing them.</item>
<item>The strength of a man consists in finding out the way God is going ,and going that way.</item>
<item>Strength is a matter of a made up mind.</item>
<item>A threefold cord is not quickly broken.</item>
<item>We live in a wondrous time in which the strong is weak because of his moral scruples and the weak grows strong because of his audacity.</item>
<item>Gentleness corrects whatever is offensive in our manner.</item>
<item>A fundamental mistake to call vehemence and rigidity strength! A man is not strong who takes convulsion fits though six men cannot hold him then. He that can walk under the heaviest weight without staggering ,he is the strong man    A man who cannot hold his peace ,till the time come for speaking and acting ,is no right man.</item>
<item>It is truly said It does not take much strength to do things ,but it requires great strength to decide what to do.</item>
<item>Don t expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong.</item>
<item>Our real problem ,then ,is not our strength today it is rather the vital necessity of action today to ensure our strength tomorrow.</item>
<item>We acquire the strength we have overcome.</item>
<item>There is always room for a person of force and they make room for many.</item>
<item>I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time.</item>
<item>Superior strength is found in the long run to lie with those who had right on their side.</item>
<item>The people rate strength before everything.</item>
<item>Tenderness is a virtue.</item>
<item>There is nothing stronger in the world than gentleness.</item>
<item>Strength was the virtue of paganism obedience is the virtue of Christianity.</item>
<item>Rudeness is the weak man s imitation of strength.</item>
<item>The journey is the reward.</item>
<item>If you want 1 year of prosperity ,grow grain. If you want 10 years of prosperity ,grow trees. If you want 100 years of prosperity ,grow people.</item>
<item>A full cup must be carried steadily.</item>
<item>Success always occurs in private ,and failure in full view.</item>
<item>To laugh often and much to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends to appreciate beauty ,to find the best in others to leave the world a little better whether by a healthy child ,a garden patch or a redeemed social condition to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is the meaning of success.</item>
<item>What is a big shot except a little shot that kept on shooting.</item>
<item>Success is sweet and sweeter if long delayed and gotten through many struggles and defeats.</item>
<item>We climb to heaven most often on the ruins of our cherished plans ,finding our failures were successes.</item>
<item>If at first you don t succeed you are running about average.</item>
<item>I never thought of losing ,but now that it s happened ,the only thing is to do it right. That s my obligation to all the people who believe in me. We all have to take defeats in life.</item>
<item>For true success ask yourself these four questions Why? Why not? Why not me? Why not now? </item>
<item>Eighty percent of success is showing up.</item>
<item>It s simply a matter of doing what you do best and not worrying about what the other fellow is going to do.</item>
<item>Success has nothing to do with happiness.</item>
<item>Success is the person who year after year reaches the highest limits in his field.</item>
<item>If you find it in your heart to care for somebody else ,you will have succeeded.</item>
<item>You are wholly complete and your success in life will be in direct proportion to your ability to accept this truth about you.</item>
<item>For what is the best choice ,for each individual is the highest it is possible for him to achieve.</item>
<item>We fall forward to succeed.</item>
<item>For every failure ,there s an alternative course of action. You just have to find it. When you come to a roadblock ,take a detour.</item>
<item>I </item>
<item>To believe in yourself and to follow your dreams ,to have goals in life and a drive to succeed ,and to surround yourself with the things and the people that make you happy this is success! </item>
<item>Success ,or failure ,very often arrives on wings that seem mysterious to us.</item>
<item>Many a man owes his success to his first wife and his second wife to his success.</item>
<item>Prosperity discovers vice ,adversity discovers virtue.</item>
<item>For everything you have missed ,you have gained something else and for everything you gain ,you lose something else.</item>
<item>Every great achievement is the victory of a flaming heart.</item>
<item>One principle reason why men are so often useless is that they divide and shift their attention among a multiplicity of objects and pursuits.</item>
<item>The greater the difficulty the more glory in surmounting it. Skillful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests.</item>
<item>Success has a simple formula do your best ,and people may like it.</item>
<item>Death comes to all But great achievements build a monument which shall endure until the sun grows cold.</item>
<item>What is the recipe for successful achievement? To my mind there are just four essential ingredients Choose a career you love ,give it the best there is in you ,seize your opportunities ,and be a member of the team.</item>
<item>Success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on after others have let go.</item>
<item>When I am delivering my very best ,then that is when I feel successful.</item>
<item>There are opportunities everywhere ,just as there have always been...</item>
<item>Success is the sum of details.</item>
<item>It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed.</item>
<item>It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed.</item>
<item>Success is the sum of details.</item>
<item>The real winners are not those at the top but those who have come the farthest over the toughest roads. Your victory may never make the headlines. But you will know about it ,and that s what counts.</item>
<item>Victory is a thing of the will.</item>
<item>I have found it is much easier to make a success in life than to make a success of one s life.</item>
<item>Success follows doing what you want to do. There is no other way to be successful.</item>
<item>The man who will use his skill and constructive imagination to see how much he can give for a dollar ,instead of how little he can give for a dollar ,is bound to succeed.</item>
<item>Failure or success seem to have been allotted to men by their stars. But they retain the power of wriggling ,of fighting with their star or against it ,and in the whole universe the only really interesting movement is this wriggle.</item>
<item>The prospect of success in achieving our most cherished dream is not without its terrors. Who is more deprived and alone than the man who has achieved his dream? </item>
<item>You will find the key to success under the alarm clock.</item>
<item>Would you live with ease ,do what you should ,and not what you please. Success has ruined many a man.</item>
<item>The only way around is through.</item>
<item>The great recipe for success is to work ,and always work.</item>
<item> If the secret sorrows of everyone could be read on their forehead ,how many who now cause envy would suddenly become the objects of pity.</item>
<item>Strengthen me by sympathizing with my strength ,not my weakness.</item>
<item>Sympathy is the first condition of criticism.</item>
<item>One cannot weep for the entire world ,it is beyond human strength. One must choose.</item>
<item>Pity makes the world soft to the weak and noble to the strong.</item>
<item>Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.</item>
<item>The force of truth that a statement imparts ,then ,its prominence among the hordes of recorded observations that I may optionally apply to my own life ,depends ,in addition to the sense that it is argumentatively defensible ,on the sense that someone like me ,and someone I like ,whose voice is audible and who is at least notionally in the same room with me ,does or can possibly hold it to be compellingly true.</item>
<item>The delicate and infirm go for sympathy ,not to the well and buoyant ,but to those who have suffered like themselves.</item>
<item>Pity cost nothing and ain t worth nothing.</item>
<item>Can I see another s woe ,and not be in sorrow too? Can I see another s grief ,and not seek for kind relief? </item>
<item>God put self pity by the side of despair like the cure by the side of the disease.</item>
<item>Those who would make us feel ,must feel themselves.</item>
<item>A tear dries quickly when it is shed for troubles of others.</item>
<item>All sympathy not consistent with acknowledged virtue is but disguised selfishness.</item>
<item>Pity is a thing often vowed ,seldom felt hatred is a thing often felt ,seldom avowed.</item>
<item>Humane sentiments are baseless ,mad ,and improper they are incredibly feeble never do they withstand the gainsaying passions ,never do they resist bare necessity.</item>
<item>The people that I care about are the people out there on the street. I can identify with them.</item>
<item>Sympathy is never wasted except when you give it to yourself.</item>
<item>More helpful than all wisdom is one draught of simple human pity that will not forsake us.</item>
<item>Sympathetic people often don t communicate well ,they back reflected images which hide their own depths.</item>
<item>Sympathy is a supporting atmosphere ,and in it we unfold easily and well.</item>
<item>When Man evolved Pity ,he did a queer thing deprived himself of the power of living life as it is without wishing it to become something different.</item>
<item>Seldom in the business and transactions of ordinary life ,do we find the sympathy we want.</item>
<item>Pity and friendship are two passions incompatible with each other.</item>
<item>Love and death are the two great hinges on which all human sympathies turn.</item>
<item>Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he will eat for the rest of his life.</item>
<item>Teachers open the door ,but you must enter by yourself.</item>
<item>To teach well ,we need not say all that we know ,Successful teachers are effective in spite of the psychological theories they suffer under.</item>
<item>Never offer to teach a fish to swim.</item>
<item>In teaching others we teach ourselves.</item>
<item>He who does not research has nothing to teach.</item>
<item>Whatever you teach ,be brief what is quickly said the mind readily receives and faithfully retains ,while everything superfluous runs over as from a full container. Who knows much says least.</item>
<item>He who undertakes to be his own teacher has a fool for a pupil.</item>
<item>A teacher affects eternity he can never tell where his influence stops.</item>
<item>The true teacher defends his pupils against his own personal influence. He inspires self distrust. He guides their eyes from himself to the spirit that quickens him. He will have no disciple.</item>
<item>To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music. Then ,by simply changing the key ,we keep up the attraction and vary the song.</item>
<item>The one exclusive sign of thorough knowledge is the power of teaching.</item>
<item>My object will be ,if possible ,to form Christian men ,for Christian boys I can scarcely hope to make.</item>
<item>No other job in the world could possibly dispossess one so completely as this job of teaching. You could stand all day in a laundry ,for instance ,still in possession of your mind. But this teaching utterly obliterates you. It cuts right into your being essentially ,it takes over your spirit. It drags it out from where it would hide.</item>
<item>A professor is one who talks in someone else s sleep.</item>
<item>You can t teach a hunter it s wrong to kill.</item>
<item>Learning is finding out what we already know. Doing is demonstrating that you know it. Teaching is reminding others that they know just as well as you. You are all learners ,doers and teachers.</item>
<item>You teach best what you most need to learn.</item>
<item>A schoolmaster should have an atmosphere of awe ,and walk wonderingly ,as if he was amazed at being himself.</item>
<item>When will the public cease to insult the teacher s calling with empty flattery? When will men who would never for a moment encourage their own sons to enter the work of the public schools cease to tell us that education is the greatest and noblest of all human callings? </item>
<item>I believe that every human soul is teaching something to someone nearly every minute here in mortality.</item>
<item>I am quite sure that in the hereafter she will take me by the hand and lead me to my proper seat.</item>
<item>Teaching is not a lost art ,but the regard for it is a lost tradition.</item>
<item>I am sure it is one s duty as a teacher to try to show boys that no opinions ,no tastes ,no emotions are worth much unless they are one s own. I suffered acutely as a boy from the lack of being shown this.</item>
<item>Unless we do his teachings ,we do not demonstrate faith in him.</item>
<item>Contemporary American children ,if they are old enough to grasp the concept of Santa Claus by Thanksgiving ,are able to see through it by December 15th.</item>
<item> Thanksgiving dinners take eighteen hours to prepare. They are consumed in twelve minutes. Half times take twelve minutes. This is not coincidence.</item>
<item> What we re really talking about is a wonderful day set aside on the fourth Thursday of November when no one diets. I mean ,why else would they call it Thanksgiving? </item>
<item> We re having something a little different this year for Thanksgiving. Instead of a turkey ,we re having a swan. You get more stuffing.</item>
<item>If the only prayer you said in your whole life was ,thank you ,that would suffice.</item>
<item> I awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends ,the old and new.</item>
<item>Life without thankfulness is devoid of love and passion. Hope without thankfulness is lacking in fine perception. Faith without thankfulness lacks strength and fortitude. Every virtue divorced from thankfulness is maimed and limps along the spiritual road.</item>
<item>Thanksgiving Day is a day devoted by persons with inflammatory rheumatism to thanking a loving Father that it is not hydrophobia.</item>
<item>One thing you can t recycle is wasted time.</item>
<item>Monday is the key day of the week.</item>
<item>An inch of time cannot be bought with an inch of gold.</item>
<item>There is but an hour a day between a good housewife and a bad one.</item>
<item>Time is the soul of business.</item>
<item>With time and patience the mulberry leaf becomes a silk gown.</item>
<item>Time goes by so fast ,people go in and out of your life. You must never miss the opportunity to tell these people how much they mean to you.</item>
<item>Everything passes ,everything perishes ,everything palls.</item>
<item>Life is half spent before one knows what it is.</item>
<item>Love makes time pass away and time makes love pass away.</item>
<item>Why kill time when one can employ it.</item>
<item>Forever is a long bargain.</item>
<item>The morning hour has gold in its mouth.</item>
<item>Even a clock that is not going is right twice a day.</item>
<item>Time and I against any two.</item>
<item>The longest day soon comes to an end.</item>
<item>Soon enough is well enough.</item>
<item>Now is the watchword of the wise.</item>
<item>Lost time is never found again.</item>
<item>We are preoccupied with time. If we could learn to love space as deeply as we are now obsessed with time ,we might discover a new meaning in the phrase to live like men.</item>
<item>It is all very beautiful and magical here a quality which cannot be described. You have to live it and breathe it ,let the sun bake into you. The skies and the lands are so enormous ,and the detail so precise and exquisite that wherever you are you are isolated into a glowing world between the macro and the micro ,where everything is sidewise under you and over you ,and the clocks stopped long ago.</item>
<item>Eternity! thou pleasing ,dreadful thought.</item>
<item>I cannot afford to waste my time making money.</item>
<item>Since time is the one immaterial object which we cannot influence neither speed up nor slow down ,add to nor diminish it is an imponderably valuable gift.</item>
<item>He who lets time rule him will live the life of a slave.</item>
<item>It is an equal failing to trust everybody ,and to trust nobody.</item>
<item>Never trust the man who tells you all his troubles but keeps from you all his joys.</item>
<item>Trust is the lubrication that makes it possible for organizations to work.</item>
<item>Though he slay me ,I shall yet trust Him.</item>
<item>Trust in the Lord with all your heart and don t lean on your own understanding. In all things acknowledge him ,and he shall direct your way. Proverbs 3 5 ,6 </item>
<item>Being taken for granted can be a compliment. It means that you ve become a comfortable ,trusted person in another person s life.</item>
<item>Build a little fence of trust around today Fill the space with loving deeds,And therein stay.Look not through the sheltering bars Upon tomorrow God will help thee bear what comes of joy and sorrow.</item>
<item>The man who trusts men will make fewer mistakes that he who distrusts them.</item>
<item>I cannot give them my confidence pardon me ,gentlemen ,confidence is a plant of slow growth in an aged bosom youth is the season of credulity.</item>
<item>Never trust a man who speaks well of everybody.</item>
<item>Who would not rather trust and be deceived? </item>
<item>Candid and generous and just. Boys care but little whom they trust. An error soon corrected for who but learns in riper years. That man ,when smoothest he appears ,is most to be suspected? </item>
<item>I confess that I cannot understand how we can plot ,lie ,cheat and commit murder abroad and remain humane ,honorable ,trustworthy and trusted at home.</item>
<item>You may be deceived if you trust too much ,but you will live in torment if you don t trust enough.</item>
<item>Put your trust in God and keep your powder dry.</item>
<item>He who trusts secrets to a servant makes him his master.</item>
<item>Trust everybody ,but cut the cards.</item>
<item>No ,I don t understand my husband s theory of relativity ,but I know my husband ,and I know he can be trusted.</item>
<item>Trust men and they will be true to you treat them greatly and they will show themselves great.</item>
<item>Trust thyself every heart vibrates to that iron string.</item>
<item>Trust instinct to the end ,even though you can give no reason.</item>
<item>The highest compact we can make with our fellow is Let there be truth between us two forevermore.</item>
<item>Self trust is the essence of heroism.</item>
<item>All I have seen teaches me to trust the creator for all I have not seen.</item>
<item>Beware of anyone who says they know. Trust me ,they don t ,or they wouldn t have to say they did.</item>
<item>A half truth is a whole lie.</item>
<item>Better suffer for the truth than prosper in a falsehood.</item>
<item>Truth is heavy ,so few men carry it.</item>
<item>A truth spoken before its time is dangerous.</item>
<item>It is the truth that irritates a person.</item>
<item>If you speak the truth ,have a foot in the stirrup.</item>
<item>Time tries truth.</item>
<item>Tell the truth and then run.</item>
<item>Truth is the daughter of time.</item>
<item>Truth fears nothing but concealment.</item>
<item>Too much truth is uncouth.</item>
<item>The truth is often a terrible weapon of aggression. It is possible to lie ,and even to murder ,for the truth.</item>
<item>That in the beginning when the world was young there were a great many thoughts but no such thing as truth. Man made the truths himself and each truth was a composite of a great many vague thoughts. All about in the world were truths and they were all beautiful.</item>
<item>The trouble with lying and deceiving is that their efficiency depends entirely upon a clear notion of the truth that the liar and deceiver wishes to hide. In this sense ,truth ,even if it does not prevail in public ,possesses an ineradicable primacy over all falsehoods.</item>
<item>The least initial deviation from the truth is multiplied later a thousandfold.</item>
<item>Plato is dear to me ,but dearer still is truth.</item>
<item>Truth sits upon the lips of dying men.</item>
<item>One universe made up all that is and one God in it all ,and one principle of being ,and one law ,the reason shared by all thinking creatures ,and one truth.</item>
<item>We catch on to the truth and technique of expectation in those rare moments when we are stirred by an awareness of a guidance seemingly higher and greater than our own ,when for a little while we are taken over by a force and an intelligence above and beyond those commonly felt. Confident and free ,filled with wonder and ready acceptance ,we permit ourselves to be taken over by our unquestioning self.</item>
<item>Not being known doesn t stop the truth from being true.</item>
<item>Error always addresses the passions and prejudices truth scorns such mean intrigue ,and only addresses the understanding and the conscience.</item>
<item>Truth arises more readily from error than from confusion.</item>
<item>What is truth? said jesting Pilate and would not stay for an answer.</item>
<item>It is a pleasure to stand upon the shore ,and to see ships tost upon the sea a pleasure to stand in the window of a castle ,and to see a battle and the adventures thereof below but no pleasure is comparable to standing upon the vantage ground of truth... and to see the errors ,and wanderings ,and mists ,and tempests ,in the vale below.</item>
<item>Truth is a naked and open daylight </item>
<item>No tree has branches so foolish as to fight among themselves.</item>
<item>The best armor is to keep out of range.</item>
<item>When elephants fight it is the grass that suffers.</item>
<item>You ve never lived until you ve almost died ,for those who fought for it ,life has a flavor the protected will never know.</item>
<item>To call war the soil of courage and virtue is like calling debauchery the soil of love.</item>

<item>Weapons are like money no one knows the meaning of enough.</item>
<item>O can t you see ,brother Death s a congested road for fighters now ,and hero a cheap label.</item>
<item>The chief reason warfare is still with us is neither a secret death wish of the human species ,nor an irrepressible instinct of aggression ,nor ,finally and more plausibly ,the serious economic and social dangers inherent in disarmament ,but the simple fact that no substitute for this final arbiter in international affairs has yet appeared on the political scene.</item>
<item>If you ask a member of this generation two simple questions How do you want the world to be in fifty years? and What do you want your life to be like five years from now? the answers are quite often preceded by Provided there is still a world and Provided I am still alive. To the often heard question ,Who are they ,this new generation? one is tempted to answer ,Those who hear the ticking. And to the other question ,Who are they who utterly deny them? the answer may well be ,Those who do not know ,or refuse to face ,things as they really are.</item>
<item>John Dalton s records ,carefully preserved for a century ,were destroyed during the World War II bombing of Manchester. It is not only the living who are killed in war.</item>
<item>From the happy expression on their faces you might have supposed that they welcomed the war. I have met with men who loved stamps ,and stones ,and snakes ,but I could not imagine any man loving war.</item>
<item>The best armor is to keep out of gunshot.</item>
<item>War both needs and generates certain virtues not the highest ,but what may be called the preliminary virtues ,as valor ,veracity ,the spirit of obedience ,the habit of discipline. Any of these ,and of others like them ,when possessed by a nation ,and no matter how generated ,will give them a military advantage ,and make them more likely to stay in the race of nations.</item>
<item>Conquest is the missionary of valor ,and the hard impact of military virtues beats meanness out of the world.</item>
<item>We </item>
<item>If goods don t cross borders ,armies will.</item>
<item>The cannon thunders... limbs fly in all directions... one can hear the groans of victims and the howling of those performing the sacrifice... it s Humanity in search of happiness.</item>
<item>It takes twenty years or more of peace to make a man it takes only twenty seconds of war to destroy him.</item>
<item>If you live long enough ,you ll see that every victory turns into a defeat.</item>
<item>If we justify war ,it is because all peoples always justify the traits of which they find themselves possessed ,not because war will bear an objective examination of its merits.</item>
<item>All war represents a failure of diplomacy.</item>
<item>The inevitableness ,the idealism ,and the blessing of war ,as an indispensable and stimulating law of development ,must be repeatedly emphasized.</item>
<item>If we fight a war and win it with H bombs ,what history will remember is not the ideals we were fighting for but the methods we used to accomplish them. These methods will be compared to the warfare of Genghis Khan who ruthlessly killed every last inhabitant of Persia.</item>
<item>A nation s treasure is its scholars.</item>
<item>A single conversation across the table with a wise man is worth a month s study of books.</item>
<item>Beauty is the wisdom of women. Wisdom is the beauty of men.</item>
<item>Deep doubts ,deep wisdom small doubts ,little wisdom.</item>
<item>Wise care keeps what it has gained.</item>
<item>A wise man never knows all ,only fools know everything </item>
<item>You are wise to climb Mt. Fuji ,but a fool to do it twice.</item>
<item>The heart of the wise man lies quiet like limpid water.</item>
<item>By others faults the wise correct their own.</item>
<item>The wise person has long ears and a short tongue.</item>
<item>Everyone is wise until he speaks.</item>
<item>He alone is wise who can accommodate himself to all contingencies of life but the fool contends ,and struggling ,like a swimmer ,against the stream.</item>
<item>The foolish sayings of a rich man pass for wise ones.</item>
<item>Even though you know a thousand things ,ask the man who knows one.</item>
<item>We cannot advance without new experiments in living ,but no wise man tries every day what he has proved wrong the day before.</item>
<item>Wise people ,even though all laws were abolished ,would still lead the same life.</item>
<item>Suppose that we are wise enough to learn and know and yet not wise enough to control our learning and knowledge ,so that we use it to destroy ourselves? Even if that is so ,knowledge remains better than ignorance. It is better to know even if the knowledge endures only for the moment that comes before destruction than to gain eternal life at the price of a dull and swinish lack of comprehension of a universe that swirls unseen before us in all its wonder. That was the choice of Achilles ,and it is mine ,too.</item>
<item>The wise man sees in the misfortune of others what he should avoid.</item>
<item>In seeking wisdom thou art wise in imagining that thou hast attained it ,thou art a fool.</item>
<item>There is a difference between happiness and wisdom he that thinks himself the happiest man is really so but he that thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool.</item>
<item>Silence is the sleep that nourishes wisdom.</item>
<item>Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise. Seek what they sought.</item>
<item>Wise men still seek Him today.</item>
<item>Just as a fire is covered by smoke and a mirror is obscured by dust ,just as the embryo rests deep within the womb ,wisdom is hidden by selfish desire.</item>
<item>Action should culminate in wisdom.</item>
<item>Remember the ladies ,and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands.Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies we are determined to foment a Rebellion ,and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice ,or Representation.</item>
<item>Three things have been difficult to tame the oceans ,fools and women. We may soon be able to tame the oceans fools and women will take a little longer.</item>
<item>Woman is the salvation or the destruction of the family. She carries its destiny in the folds of her mantle.</item>
<item>A woman is sometimes fugitive ,irrational ,indeterminable ,illogical and contradictory. A great deal of forbearance ought to be shown her ,and a good deal of prudence exercised with regard to her ,for she may bring about innumerable evils without knowing it. Capable of all kinds of devotion ,and of all kinds of treason ,monster incomprehensible ,raised to the second power ,she is at once the delight and the terror of man.</item>
<item>The sadness of the women s movement is that they don t allow the necessity of love. See ,I don t personally trust any revolution where love is not allowed.</item>
<item>A woman who is convinced that she deserves to accept only the best challenges herself to give the best. Then she is living phenomenally.</item>
<item>Men ,their rights and nothing more women ,their rights and nothing less.</item>
<item>These impossible women! How they do get around us! The poet was right Can t live with them ,or without them.</item>
<item>Single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor. Which is one very strong argument in favor of matrimony.</item>
<item>To look almost pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain for the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive.</item>
<item>When women love us ,they forgive us everything ,even our crimes when they do not love us ,they give us credit for nothing ,not even out virtues.</item>
<item>Women get more unhappy the more they try to liberate themselves.</item>
<item>It s a sort of bloom on a woman. If you have it you don t need to have anything else and if you don t have it ,it doesn t much matter what else you have.</item>
<item>What Women Want To be loved ,to be listened to ,to be desired ,to be respected ,to be needed ,to be trusted ,and sometimes ,just to be held. What Men Want Tickets for the world series.</item>
<item>The being who ,for most men ,is the source of the most lively ,and even ,be it said ,to the shame of philosophical delights ,the most lasting joys the being towards or for whom all their efforts tend for whom and by whom fortunes are made and lost for whom ,but especially by whom ,artists and poets compose their most delicate jewels from whom flow the most enervating pleasures and the most enriching sufferings woman ,in a word ,is not ,for the artist in general... only the female of the human species. She is rather a divinity ,a star.</item>
<item>We have dreamt of every woman there is ,and dreamt too of the miracle that would bring us the pleasure of being a woman ,for women have all the qualities courage ,passion ,the capacity to love ,cunning whereas all our imagination can do is naively pile up the illusion of courage.</item>
<item>When an individual is kept in a situation of inferiority ,the fact is that he does become inferior.</item>
<item>Femininity appears to be one of those pivotal qualities that is so important no one can define it.</item>
<item>Women have no wilderness in them. They are provident instead content in the tight hot cell of their hearts. To eat dusty bread.</item>
<item>My type of humor is almost pure identification. A housewife reads my column and says ,But that s happened to ME! I know just what she s talking about! </item>
<item>While a person gets they can never lose.</item>
<item>Do not employ handsome servants.</item>
<item>If you suspect a man ,don t employ him ,and if you employ him ,don t suspect him.</item>
<item>A man grows most tired while standing still.</item>
<item>If a task has once begun.Never leave it till it s done.Be the labor great or small.Do it well or not at all.</item>
<item>The Devil finds work for idle hands.</item>
<item>The man who has nothing to do is always the busiest.</item>
<item>Work relieves us from three great evils ,boredom ,vice ,and want.</item>
<item>The work praises the man.</item>
<item>A dog that barks much is never a good hunter.</item>
<item>No bees ,no honey no work ,no money.</item>
<item>Plaster thick ,some will stick.</item>
<item>Want is the mother of industry.</item>
<item>The secret of life is not to do what you like ,but to like what you do.</item>
<item>Work is a part of life ,not the point of it.</item>
<item>The tougher the job ,the greater the reward.</item>
<item>Something made greater by ourselves and in turn that makes us greater.</item>
<item>If you re not a white male ,consider sales seriously. Most employers ,regardless of how sexist or racist they may be ,will pay for any sales they can get. And they care little for the color or gender of the person who brings that business to the firm. Most will be glad to get the business even if it comes from a green ,bisexual Martian.</item>
<item>Never tire yourself more than necessary ,even if you have to found a culture on the fatigue of your bones.</item>
<item>Whatever muscles I have are the product of my own hard work and nothing else.</item>
<item>Don t be condescending to unskilled labor. Try it for a half a day first.</item>
<item>In order that people may be happy in their work ,these three things are needed They must be fit for it they must not do too much of it and they must have a sense of success in it not a doubtful sense ,such as needs some testimony of others for its confirmation ,but a sure sense ,or rather knowledge ,that so much work has been done well ,and fruitfully done ,whatever the world may say or think about it.</item>
<item>A tremendous number of people in America work very hard at something that bores them. Even a rich man thinks he has to go down to the office everyday. Not because he likes it but because he can t think of anything else to do.</item>
<item>I am afraid that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety.</item>
<item>Work is either fun or drudgery. It depends on your attitude. I like fun.</item>
<item>The children now love luxury they have bad manners ,contempt for authority they allow disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children now are tyrants ,not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents ,chatter before company ,gobble up dainties at the table ,cross their legs ,and tyrannize their teachers.</item>
<item>Youth lives on hope ,old age on memories.</item>
<item>If youth but had the knowledge and old age the strength.</item>
<item>All lovely things will have an ending ,All lovely things will fade and die And youth ,that s now so bravely spending ,Will beg a penny by and by.</item>
<item>The young are permanently in a state resembling intoxication.</item>
<item>They Young People have exalted notions ,because they have not been humbled by life or learned its necessary limitations moreover ,their hopeful disposition makes them think themselves equal to great things and that means having exalted notions. They would always rather do noble deeds than useful ones Their lives are regulated more by moral feeling than by reasoning all their mistakes are in the direction of doing things excessively and vehemently. They overdo everything they love too much ,hate too much ,and the same with everything else.</item>
<item>I ve never understood why people consider youth a time of freedom and joy. It s probably because they have forgotten their own.</item>
<item>Young people are fitter to invent than to judge fitter for execution than for counsel and more fit for new projects than for settled business.</item>
<item>Youth is not a question of years one is young or old from birth.</item>
<item>I m youth ,I m joy ,I m a little bird that has broken out of the egg.</item>
<item>What a cunning mixture of sentiment ,pity ,tenderness ,irony surrounds adolescence ,what knowing watchfulness! Young birds on their first flight are hardly so hovered around.</item>
<item>Rejoice ,O young man ,in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth ,and walk in the ways of thine heart ,and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou ,that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. Ecclesiastes 11 9 </item>
<item>It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. Lamentations 3 27 </item>
<item>Heaven lies about us in our infancy and the world begins lying about us pretty soon afterward.</item>
<item>When I was a boy of fourteen ,my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty one ,I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.</item>
<item>Nobody understands anyone 18 ,including those who are 18.</item>
<item>But childhood prolonged ,cannot remain a fairyland. It becomes a hell.</item>
<item>I m trying very hard to understand this generation. They have adjusted the timetable for childbearing so that menopause and teaching a sixteen year old how to drive a car will occur in the same week.</item>
<item>Time misspent in youth is sometimes all the freedom one ever has.</item>
<item>What Youth deemed crystal ,Age finds out was dew.</item>
<item>The young do not know enough to be prudent ,and therefore they attempt the impossible and achieve it ,generation after generation.</item>
<item>Youth ,with swift feet ,walks onward in the way the land of joy lies all before his eyes.</item>
<item>The arrogance of age must submit to be taught by youth.</item>
<item>So much alarmed that she is quite alarming ,All Giggle ,Blush ,half Pertness ,and half Pout.</item>
<item>Today s younger generation is no worse than my own. We were just as ignorant and repulsive as they are ,but nobody listened to us.</item>
