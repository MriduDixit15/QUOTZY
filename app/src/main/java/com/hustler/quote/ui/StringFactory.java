            "R. W. Dale\n" +
            "One of my less pleasant chores when I was young was to read the Bible from one end to the other. Reading the Bible straight through is at least 70 percent discipline, like learning Latin. But the good parts are, of course, simply amazing. God is an extremely uneven writer, but when He's good, nobody can touch Him.\n" +

            "W. H. Auden\n" +
            "Literary imagination is an aesthetic object offered by a writer to a lover of books.\n" +
            "Gaston Bachelard\n" +

            "Roland Barthes\n" +
            "In the present age, alas! our pens are ravished by unlettered authors and unmannered critics, that make a havoc rather than a building, a wilderness rather than a garden. But, a lack! what boots it to drop tears upon the preterit?\n" +
            "Aubrey Beardsley\n" +

            "Robert Benchley\n" +
            "The book borrower...proves himself to be an inveterate collector of books not so much by the fervor with which he guards his borrowed treasures...as by his failure to read these books.\n" +
            "Walter Benjamin\n" +
            "Definition of a classic: a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have.\n" +

            "W. E. B. Du Bois\n" +
            "Literature is not exhaustible, for the sufficient and simple reason that a single book is not. A book is not an isolated entity: it is a narration, an axis of innumerable narrations. One literature differs from another, either before or after it, not so much because of the text as for the manner in which it is read.\n" +

            "All literature is political.\n" +
            "LeVar Burton\n" +
            "English literature is a kind of training in social ethics. English trains you to handle a body of information in a way that is conducive to action.\n" +
            "Marilyn Butler\n" +
            "The struggle of literature is in fact a struggle to escape from the confines of language; it stretches out from the utmost limits of what can be said; what stirs literature is the call and attraction of what is not in the dictionary.\n" +
            "Italo Calvino\n" +
            "When politicians and politically minded people pay too much attention to literature, it is a bad sign -- a bad sign mostly for literature. But it is also a bad sign when they don't want to hear the word mentioned.\n" +
            "Italo Calvino\n" +
            "A classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say.\n" +

            "John Quincy Adams\n" +
            "Courage that grows from constitution often forsakes a man when he has occasion for it; courage which arises from a sense of duty acts ;in a uniform manner.\n" +
            "Joseph Addison\n" +
            "There is another side to chivalry. If it dispenses leniency, it may with equal justification invoke control.\n" +
            "Freda Adler\n" +
            "It is easy to be brave from a safe distance.\n" +
            "Aesop\n" +
            "As a rock on the seashore he standeth firm, and the dashing of the waves disturbeth him not. He raiseth his head like a tower on a hill, and the arrows of fortune drop at his feet. In the instant of danger, the courage of his heart here, and scorn to fly.\n" +

            "Vittorio Alfieri\n" +

            "Aristotle\n" +
            "It is easy to fly into a passion... anybody can do that, but to be angry with the right person to the right extent and at the right time and in the right way that is not easy.\n" +
            "Aristotle\n" +
            "The beauty of the soul shines out when a man bears with composure one heavy mischance after another, not because he does not feel them, but because he is a man of high and heroic temper.\n" +
            "Aristotle\n" +
            "Boldness is ever blind, for it sees not dangers and inconveniences whence it is bad in council though good in execution.\n" +
            "Francis Bacon\n" +
            "The brave man is not he who feels no fear, For that were stupid and irrational; But he, whose noble soul its fears subdues, And bravely dares the danger nature shrinks from.\n" +
