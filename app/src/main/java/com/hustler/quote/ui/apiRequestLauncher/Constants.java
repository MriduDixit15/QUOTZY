    public static final String val ="Ken Robinson Work, Creativity, Culture Teamwork requires some sacrifice up front; people who work as a team have to put the collective needs of the group ahead of their individual interests. Patrick Lencioni Work, Teamwork, Team There is no substitute for hard work. Thomas A. Edison Hard Work, Work, Hard When nature has work to be done, she creates a genius to do it. Ralph Waldo Emerson Work, Nature, Genius Look at the sky. We are not alone. The whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Work, Best, Sky Luck is great, but most of life is hard work. Iain Duncan Smith Life, Hard Work, Work Everyone has been made for some particular work, and the desire for that work has been put in every heart. Rumi Work, Heart, Desire Sports teaches you to understand the meaning of a team. You need to be able to work with everybody; you don't have to be their best friend. You can experience the fun of competition and driving toward a common goal without pushing to bond in some major way with each individual on a project. Kathleen Kennedy Work, Best Friend, Sports We are constituted so that simple acts of kindness, such as giving to charity or expressing gratitude, have a positive effect on our long-term moods. The key to the happy life, it seems, is the good life: a life with sustained relationships, challenging work, and connections to community. Paul Bloom Life, Positive, Work Once you have commitment, you need the discipline and hard work to get you there. Haile Gebrselassie Hard Work, Work, Commitment Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I have really worked, is mine. Nikola Tesla Work, Future, Truth All life demands struggle. Those who have everything given to them become lazy, selfish, and insensitive to the real values of life. The very striving and hard work that we so constantly try to avoid is the major building block in the person we are today. Pope Paul VI Life, Hard Work, Work You see, God helps only people who work hard. That principle is very clear. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Work, God, Work Hard That's been one of my mantras - focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains. Steve Jobs Work, End, Work Hard I love my wife and I know she loves me. We're best friends. We're just lucky to have found each other. It takes a lot of work but I just feel very blessed that I found the right person. It's a very fortunate situation and not everyone has that. Harry Connick, Jr. Love, Work, Friends Being busy does not always mean real work. The object of all work is production or accomplishment and to either of these ends there must be forethought, system, planning, intelligence, and honest purpose, as well as perspiration. Seeming to do is not doing. Thomas A. Edison Work, Intelligence, Planning I know of no single formula for success. But over the years I have observed that some attributes of leadership are universal and are often about finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration to work together. Queen Elizabeth II Leadership, Success, Work Feelings aroused by the touch of someone's hand, the sound of music, the smell of a flower, a beautiful sunset, a work of art, love, laughter, hope and faith - all work on both the unconscious and the conscious aspects of the self, and they have physiological consequences as well. Bernie Siegel Love, Work, Music Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The sun's rays do not burn until brought to a focus. Alexander Graham Bell Work, Sun, Focus Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work. Thomas A. Edison Work, Opportunity, People There is simply no substitute for hard work when it comes to achieving success. Heather Bresch Success, Hard Work, Work Through hard work, perseverance and a faith in God, you can live your dreams. Ben Carson Hard Work, Work, Dreams The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. Deepika Padukone Hard Work, Work, Fruit Education must not simply teach work - it must teach Life. W. E. B. Du Bois Life, Education, Work Leave your ego at the door every morning, and just do some truly great work. Few things will make you feel better than a job brilliantly done. Robin S. Sharma Work, Morning, Great Inspiration is one thing and you can't control it, but hard work is what keeps the ship moving. Good luck means, work hard. Keep up the good work. Kevin Eubanks Hard Work, Work, Good Pray as though everything depended on God. Work as though everything depended on you. Saint Augustine Work, Faith, God I think about my work every minute of the day. Jeff Koons Work, Day, Think Right now I am trying to be in a place of calm, a place where I can chill out and then handle the chaos of life better. You don't just get it overnight; you have to work at it. It's a daily struggle. Jackee Harry Life, Work, Daily If four things are followed - having a great aim, acquiring knowledge, hard work, and perseverance - then anything can be achieved. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Hard Work, Work, Knowledge Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it. Henry Ford Work, Intelligence, Thinking Behaving like a princess is work. It's not just about looking beautiful or wearing a crown. It's more about how you are inside. Julie Andrews Work, Beautiful, Looking The best preparation for good work tomorrow is to do good work today. Elbert Hubbard Work, Today, Good Our work is the presentation of our capabilities. Edward Gibbon Work, Business, Presentation Everybody wants to be famous, but nobody wants to do the work. I live by that. You grind hard so you can play hard. At the end of the day, you put all the work in, and eventually it'll pay off. It could be in a year, it could be in 30 years. Eventually, your hard work will pay off. Kevin Hart Hard Work, Work, Day The equal right of all citizens to health, education, work, food, security, culture, science, and wellbeing - that is, the same rights we proclaimed when we began our struggle, in addition to those which emerge from our dreams of justice and equality for all inhabitants of our world - is what I wish for all. Fidel Castro Education, Work, Dreams In fitness, there are no short cuts. It involves immense discipline and hard work. Mahesh Babu Hard Work, Work, Fitness A leader's job is not to do the work for others, it's to help others figure out how to do it themselves, to get things done, and to succeed beyond what they thought possible. Simon Sinek Work, Help Others, Leader Do your work with your whole heart, and you will succeed - there's so little competition. Elbert Hubbard Motivational, Work, Heart Opportunities are usually disguised as hard work, so most people don't recognize them. Ann Landers Hard Work, Work, People While you're going through this process of trying to find the satisfaction in your work, pretend you feel satisfied. Tell yourself you had a good day. Walk through the corridors with a smile rather than a scowl. Your positive energy will radiate. If you act like you're having fun, you'll find you are having fun. Jean Chatzky Positive, Smile, Work Nothing will work unless you do. Maya Angelou Work, You, Nothing I love it when people doubt me. It makes me work harder to prove them wrong. Derek Jeter Love, Work, People The reward for work well done is the opportunity to do more. Jonas Salk Work, Opportunity, Well Done I wish everyone well, but you need to focus on yourself. You need to stop putting your hand out. Everyone wants hand outs. Everyone wants things for free. You've got to put in the work. You've got to grind. You've got go through the struggle, and you've got to get it. Conor McGregor Work, Struggle, Focus Some people say video games rot your brain, but I think they work different muscles that maybe you don't normally use. Ezra Koenig Work, Brain, Video Games If you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life. Marc Anthony Life, Love, Work My dad said, 'Stay humble, and you gotta work harder than everybody else.' My mom said, 'Always be yourself.' She always told me only God can judge me. Nate Robinson Work, Mom, God A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. William Hazlitt Smile, Work, Miracles The three great essentials to achieve anything worth while are: Hard work, Stick-to-itiveness, and Common sense. Thomas A. Edison Hard Work, Work, Wisdom One of the very rewarding aspects of my work has been the interaction with a superb group of colleagues and friends in the atmospheric sciences community. Mario J. Molina Work, Friends, Community Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers. It may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time, but the ability to form judgments requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of experience and maturity. Calvin Coolidge Hard Work, Work, Time I have moments where I feel incredibly ugly or fat, and it sucks, you know? I'll usually try to keep a positive attitude because I'm really so grateful for where I am and the life I get to live, but I definitely have to work hard not to feel insecure. Charlotte McKinney Life, Positive, Work When you have balance in your life, work becomes an entirely different experience. There is a passion that moves you to a whole new level of fulfillment and gratitude, and that's when you can do your best... for yourself and for others. Cara Delevingne Life, Work, Gratitude If you work hard and you do your best, you can do anything. Erin Heatherton Work, Best, Work Hard Football is like life - it requires perseverance, self-denial, hard work, sacrifice, dedication and respect for authority. Vince Lombardi Life, Hard Work, Work Quality is everyone's responsibility. W. Edwards Deming Work, Quality, Everyone Creating a better world requires teamwork, partnerships, and collaboration, as we need an entire army of companies to work together to build a better world within the next few decades. This means corporations must embrace the benefits of cooperating with one another. Simon Mainwaring Work, Teamwork, Together I am very proud of my mom and consider her the most courageous woman I know. With perseverance, sacrifice and hard work, she raised a family of Olympic athletes and gave us the tools and the spirit to succeed. That is something that my brothers and I will always be thankful for. Diana Lopez Family, Hard Work, Work Wishing to be friends is quick work, but friendship is a slow ripening fruit. Aristotle Friendship, Work, Friends The expectations of life depend upon diligence; the mechanic that would perfect his work must first sharpen his tools. Confucius Life, Work, Tools My father taught my siblings and me the importance of positive values and a strong ethical compass. He showed us how to be resilient, how to deal with challenges, and how to strive for excellence in all that we do. He taught us that there's nothing that we cannot accomplish if we marry vision and passion with an enduring work ethic. Ivanka Trump Positive, Work, Father I never expect to see a perfect work from an imperfect man. Alexander Hamilton Work, Man, Perfect I'm so not stylish by nature, but I've learned to work with what I have. Julie Bowen Work, Nature, Learned Hard work without talent is a shame, but talent without hard work is a tragedy. Robert Half Hard Work, Work, Talent Teamwork makes the dream work, but a vision becomes a nightmare when the leader has a big dream and a bad team. John C. Maxwell Work, Teamwork, Leader I put my heart and my soul into my work, and have lost my mind in the process. Vincent Van Gogh Work, Heart, Soul The kind of people that all teams need are people who are humble, hungry, and smart: humble being little ego, focusing more on their teammates than on themselves. Hungry, meaning they have a strong work ethic, are determined to get things done, and contribute any way they can. Smart, meaning not intellectually smart but inner personally smart. Patrick Lencioni Work, Strong, Humble I have never in my life found myself in a situation where I've stopped work and said, 'Thank God it's Friday.' But weekends are special even if your schedule is all over the place. Something tells you the weekend has arrived and you can indulge yourself a bit. Helen Mirren Life, Work, God Power means happiness; power means hard work and sacrifice. Beyonce Knowles Happiness, Hard Work, Work I've been so lucky to work with such great people: people that are such hard workers and have such a respect and appreciation for one another. Blake Lively Work, Respect, Appreciation I think the best way to get a good night sleep is to work hard throughout the day. If you work hard and, of course, work out. William H. McRaven Work, Day, Good Child slavery is a crime against humanity. Humanity itself is at stake here. A lot of work still remains, but I will see the end of child labor in my lifetime. Kailash Satyarthi Work, End, Child A work of art which did not begin in emotion is not art. Paul Cezanne Work, Art, Emotion There are two kinds of people, those who do the work and those who take the credit. Try to be in the first group; there is less competition there. Indira Gandhi Work, Competition, People Good management is the art of making problems so interesting and their solutions so constructive that everyone wants to get to work and deal with them. Paul Hawken Leadership, Work, Art Winners embrace hard work. They love the discipline of it, the trade-off they're making to win. Losers, on the other hand, see it as punishment. And that's the difference. Lou Holtz Love, Hard Work, Work There may be people who have more talent than you, but there's no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do - and I believe that. Derek Jeter Work, Believe, Talent My dreams for the future are simple: work, a happy, healthy family, a lovely long motorcycle ride, and continuing the struggle to awaken people to the need for serious human rights reform. Mike Farrell Family, Work, Future Four things for success: work and pray, think and believe. Norman Vincent Peale Success, Work, Believe Laziness may appear attractive, but work gives satisfaction. Anne Frank Work, Satisfaction, May Derive happiness in oneself from a good day's work, from illuminating the fog that surrounds us. Henri Matisse Happiness, Work, Day Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing. Theodore Roosevelt Life, Work, Best I believe in soulmates, yes, but I believe you also have to work at love. I happen to believe your soulmate doesn't have to be your partner - your soulmate could be your best friend, your sibling, it doesn't have to be the person you marry. Cheryl Cole Love, Work, Best Friend All growth depends upon activity. There is no development physically or intellectually without effort, and effort means work. Calvin Coolidge Work, Growth, Effort Football is a great deal like life in that it teaches that work, sacrifice, perseverance, competitive drive, selflessness and respect for authority is the price that each and every one of us must pay to achieve any goal that is worthwhile. Vince Lombardi Life, Work, Perseverance Working hard is very important. You're not going to get anywhere without working extremely hard. George Lucas Work, Working Hard, You I feel I am lucky. I am grateful for this life that God has given me. I am happy, as I am getting to do work that I want to do and enjoy doing it. Sonam Kapoor Life, Work, Happy Our fatigue is often caused not by work, but by worry, frustration and resentment. Dale Carnegie Work, Worry, Frustration Don't work for recognition, but do work worthy of recognition. H. Jackson Brown, Jr. Work, Recognition, Worthy Work hard. And have patience. Because no matter who you are, you're going to get hurt in your career and you have to be patient to get through the injuries. Randy Johnson Work, Patience, Work Hard I've been blessed to be somebody that's been climbing that success mountain top for years of hard work, you know, but now it's all connecting. And now, the whole world is watching, you know what I'm saying, and it feels good 'cause it's good energy. This is all positive vibes, and good vibes and good energy, so it feels incredible. DJ Khaled Positive, Success, Work The beginning is the most important part of the work. Plato Work, Important, Beginning Do not wait; the time will never be 'just right.' Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along. George Herbert Motivational, Work, Time If you're trying to achieve, there will be roadblocks. I've had them; everybody has had them. But obstacles don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it. Michael Jordan Work, Wisdom, Obstacles Financial freedom is available to those who learn about it and work for it. Robert Kiyosaki Work, Freedom, Financial I like the cold weather. It means you get work done. Noam Chomsky Work, Weather, Cold Weather I have so much chaos in my life, it's become normal. You become used to it. You have to just relax, calm down, take a deep breath and try to see how you can make things work rather than complain about how they're wrong. Tom Welling Life, Work, Deep Nothing ever comes to one, that is worth having, except as a result of hard work. Booker T. Washington Hard Work, Work, Nothing To have faith doesn't mean you get any less frustrated when you don't do your best, but you know that it's not life and death. Take what you're given, and when you continue to work hard, you will see results. That will give you the confidence you need to keep going. Tom Lehman Life, Work, Death Robots will harvest, cook, and serve our food. They will work in our factories, drive our cars, and walk our dogs. Like it or not, the age of work is coming to an end. Gray Scott Work, Food, Age Hard work opens doors and shows the world that you are serious about being one of those rare - and special - human beings who use the fullness of their talents to do their very best. Robin S. Sharma Hard Work, Work, Best I think it's important to always keep professional and surround yourself with good people, work hard, and be nice to everyone. Caroline Winberg Work, Good, Work Hard Working hard and working smart sometimes can be two different things. Byron Dorgan Work, Working Hard, Smart The greatest education in the world is watching the masters at work. Michael Jackson Education, Work, World There was a time when men thought it was sexy to have a housewife waiting for him to come home from work in her slippers, but in modern society, I think an independent woman is even more sexy. Kat Graham Work, Time, Home When the best leader's work is done the people say, 'We did it ourselves.' Lao Tzu Leadership, Work, Leader It has been a long journey, but if you dream and have the ambition and want to work hard, then you can achieve. Mo Farah Work, Journey, Work Hard Hard work pays off - hard work beats talent any day, but if you're talented and work hard, it's hard to be beat. Robert Griffin III Hard Work, Work, Day Just be yourself. Be honest, work towards a goal, and you'll achieve it. Emraan Hashmi Work, Be Yourself, Goal Communication is a skill that you can learn. It's like riding a bicycle or typing. If you're willing to work at it, you can rapidly improve the quality of evry part of your life. Brian Tracy Life, Work, Communication Let us touch the dying, the poor, the lonely and the unwanted according to the graces we have received and let us not be ashamed or slow to do the humble work. Mother Teresa Work, Humble, Lonely If you have a dream, it's definitely achievable through hard work, through dedication, sacrifice, everything. Carli Lloyd Hard Work, Work, Sacrifice Change can be frightening, and the temptation is often to resist it. But change almost always provides opportunities - to learn new things, to rethink tired processes, and to improve the way we work. Klaus Schwab Change, Work, Opportunities In the household in which I was raised, the themes were pretty simple. 'Work hard. Don't quit. Be appreciative, be thankful, be grateful, be respectful. Also, never whine, never complain. And always, for crying out loud, keep a sense of humor.' Michael Keaton Work, Thankful, Humor Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. Anne Lamott Work, Hope, Dark If you are good at studies, and you want to play cricket, you may work harder than any other person, but you may not achieve it. So it's something you have to balance in life and be practical where you are good and then channelise your efforts in the right direction to be successful in life. Mahendra Singh Dhoni Life, Work, Good Follow your dreams, work hard, practice and persevere. Make sure you eat a variety of foods, get plenty of exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Sasha Cohen Motivational, Work, Dreams Thunder is good, thunder is impressive; but it is lightning that does the work. Mark Twain Work, Good, Lightning We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. Sheryl Sandberg Work, Passion, Progress It was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today. The 40-hour work week, the minimum wage, family leave, health insurance, Social Security, Medicare, retirement plans. The cornerstones of the middle-class security all bear the union label. Barack Obama Family, Work, Today I do what I do to inspire people. They can't be inspired by an ego, a big-headed person. It doesn't work. It doesn't match. And I really want to be that role model for people, for children. I want to be real. To my fans, I want them to view me as a real person. Don't put me on a pedestal. I'm human. I make mistakes, I cry, I hurt - just like you. La'Porsha Renae Work, Children, Mistakes My great hope is to laugh as much as I cry; to get my work done and try to love somebody and have the courage to accept the love in return. Maya Angelou Love, Work, Hope You just have to find that thing that's special about you that distinguishes you from all the others, and through true talent, hard work, and passion, anything can happen. Dr. Dre Hard Work, Work, Passion If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea. Antoine de Saint-Exupery Work, Sea, Ship I've always believed that if you put in the work, the results will come. Michael Jordan Work, Results, Always From my dad I learned to be good to people, to always be honest and straightforward. I learned hard work and perseverance. Luke Bryan Hard Work, Work, Good The breaks you take from work pay you back manifold when you return because you come back with a fresher mind and newer thinking. Some of your best ideas come when you're on vacation. Gautam Singhania Work, Best, Vacation The power of one, if fearless and focused, is formidable, but the power of many working together is better. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo Work, Working Together Surround yourself with people who take their work seriously, but not themselves, those who work hard and play hard. Colin Powell Work, Work Hard, Yourself Stay open-minded; stay focused. Train hard and train smart. For me, the older I get, the smarter I have to train also, because the recovery time is longer. Work on everything: become a well-rounded fighter - don't just be good at one thing; be good at everything. Brock Lesnar Work, Time, Good Your sweetheart calls you by another's name. His eyes linger too long on your best friend. He talks with excitement about a girl at work. And the fire catches. Jealousy - that sickening combination of possessiveness, suspicion, rage, and humiliation - can overtake your mind and threaten your very core as you contemplate your rival. Helen Fisher Work, Best Friend, Eyes Work as though you would live forever, and live as though you would die today. Go another mile! Og Mandino Work, Today, Live The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of the planter - for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way. Nikola Tesla Work, Future, Man There is no higher religion than human service. To work for the common good is the greatest creed. Woodrow Wilson Work, Good, Service Today, most young women are exposed to technology at a very young age, with mobile phones, tablets, the Web or social media. They are much more proficient with technology than prior generations since they use it for all their school work, communication and entertainment. Susan Wojcicki Work, Technology, Today There's only one growth strategy: work hard. William Hague Work, Growth, Work Hard Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil. J. Paul Getty Success, Work, Work Hard I've lived in many things - boats, caravans, and buses. I've been homeless, I've had no money: everything. But I believe in magic, and having a vision. The tough times made me a warrior. I work hard. Neon Hitch Work, Tough Times, Money The medical literature tells us that the most effective ways to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and many more problems are through healthy diet and exercise. Our bodies have evolved to move, yet we now use the energy in oil instead of muscles to do our work. David Suzuki Work, Health, Medical I enjoy the celebration of my birthday as much as anyone else does, but I always remember to start my day thanking my mom because she did most of the work the day I came into the world, not to mention all she has done throughout my life that has contributed so much to the woman I am today. Christy Turlington Life, Birthday, Work Together with a culture of work, there must be a culture of leisure as gratification. To put it another way: people who work must take the time to relax, to be with their families, to enjoy themselves, read, listen to music, play a sport. Pope Francis Work, Music, Time I have no idols. I admire work, dedication and competence. Ayrton Senna Work, Dedication, Admire I would encourage you to set really high goals. Set goals that, when you set them, you think they're impossible. But then every day you can work towards them, and anything is possible, so keep working hard and follow your dreams. Katie Ledecky Work, Dreams, Day Human rights must work to uplift human dignity. Rodrigo Duterte Work, Human Rights, Rights Young people are threatened... by the evil use of advertising techniques that stimulate the natural inclination to avoid hard work by promising the immediate satisfaction of every desire. Pope John Paul II Hard Work, Work, Evil If in our daily life we can smile, if we can be peaceful and happy, not only we, but everyone will profit from it. This is the most basic kind of peace work. Nhat Hanh Life, Smile, Work The biggest challenge we all face is to learn about ourselves and to understand our strengths and weaknesses. We need to utilize our strengths, but not so much that we don't work on our weaknesses. Mae Jemison Work, Challenge, Learn There are those who love to get dirty and fix things. They drink coffee at dawn, beer after work. And those who stay clean, just appreciate things. At breakfast they have milk and juice at night. There are those who do both, they drink tea. Gary Snyder Love, Work, Coffee Whatever you do, do it with all your might. Work at it, early and late, in season and out of season, not leaving a stone unturned, and never deferring for a single hour that which can be done just as well now. P. T. Barnum Work, Season, Leaving Nature is ever at work building and pulling down, creating and destroying, keeping everything whirling and flowing, allowing no rest but in rhythmical motion, chasing everything in endless song out of one beautiful form into another. John Muir Work, Nature, Beautiful It is the working man who is the happy man. It is the idle man who is the miserable man. Benjamin Franklin Work, Happy, Man There is a saying that every nice piece of work needs the right person in the right place at the right time. Benoit Mandelbrot Work, Time, Saying Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids from gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they get done. Barack Obama Work, Violence, Minimum Wage Imagine having all of your freedoms taken away, being forced to work against your will, and constantly living under the threat of violence - in short, being forced to live as a slave. Sadly, this situation is a reality for millions of children, women, and men each year as part of the global human trafficking industry. Bill Flores Work, Children, Women Enjoy your sweat because hard work doesn't guarantee success, but without it you don't have a chance. Alex Rodriguez Success, Hard Work, Work If you must have motivation, think of your paycheck on Friday. Noel Coward Work, Motivation, Think Our deep respect for the land and its harvest is the legacy of generations of farmers who put food on our tables, preserved our landscape, and inspired us with a powerful work ethic. James H. Douglas, Jr. Work, Food, Respect Effective networking isn't a result of luck - it requires hard work and persistence. Lewis Howes Hard Work, Work, Persistence That's the thing about awards - it's for the people who do all the hard work behind the scenes. An award is just a clap at them. Sia Hard Work, Work, People A manager is not a person who can do the work better than his men; he is a person who can get his men to do the work better than he can. Frederick W. Smith Work, Men, Better Well, a lot of people don't know this about me, but I'm actually shy around people I don't know. I would just say with my first concert, my first tour, I didn't really talk onstage. I was like, 'Thank you, I love you guys,' or whatever. But now I've just kind of learned to work a crowd. Avril Lavigne Love, Work, I Love You Creativity is a habit, and the best creativity is the result of good work habits. Twyla Tharp Work, Creativity, Good Part of doing good work is caring deeply about it, believing in what you're doing, and getting incredibly attached to the characters that you're playing, the stories you're telling, and the people you're working with. Ari Graynor Work, Good, Caring What you are will show in what you do. Thomas A. Edison Work, You, Will Colleagues are a wonderful thing - but mentors, that's where the real work gets done. Junot Diaz Work, Colleagues, Real I believe that working with good people matters because then the work environment is good. If there is a sense of respect and belief among the people you work with, that is when good work is done. Ranbir Kapoor Work, Respect, Good If you really believe in what you're doing, work hard, take nothing personally and if something blocks one route, find another. Never give up. Laurie Notaro Work, Never Give Up, Believe When you form a team, why do you try to form a team? Because teamwork builds trust and trust builds speed. Russel Honore Work, Teamwork, Trust I always feel like it's two key ingredients when it comes to following your dreams, making something happen that the average person deems difficult. If you truly believe it, that's step one. Step two, is, you know, the hard work that goes along with it. J. Cole Hard Work, Work, Dreams Confront the dark parts of yourself, and work to banish them with illumination and forgiveness. Your willingness to wrestle with your demons will cause your angels to sing. August Wilson Work, Forgiveness, Yourself No work or love will flourish out of guilt, fear, or hollowness of heart, just as no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now. Alan Watts Love, Work, Future Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle. And so we must straighten our backs and work for our freedom. A man can't ride you unless your back is bent. Martin Luther King, Jr. Change, Work, Freedom My scientific studies have afforded me great gratification; and I am convinced that it will not be long before the whole world acknowledges the results of my work. Gregor Mendel Work, Great, World The moment we believe that success is determined by an ingrained level of ability as opposed to resilience and hard work, we will be brittle in the face of adversity. Joshua Waitzkin Success, Hard Work, Work I'll always use the negativity as more motivation to work even harder and become even stronger. Tim Tebow Work, Motivation, Stronger True leadership lies in guiding others to success. In ensuring that everyone is performing at their best, doing the work they are pledged to do and doing it well. Bill Owens Leadership, Success, Work Confidence doesn't come out of nowhere. It's a result of something... hours and days and weeks and years of constant work and dedication. Roger Staubach Work, Confidence, Dedication There is no prejudice that the work of art does not finally overcome. Andre Gide Work, Art, Prejudice Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all. Nelson Mandela Work, Peace, Water The only way to get love is to be lovable. It's very irritating if you have a lot of money. You'd like to think you could write a check: 'I'll buy a million dollars' worth of love.' But it doesn't work that way. The more you give love away, the more you get. Warren Buffett Love, Work, Money The average person puts only 25% of his energy and ability into his work. The world takes off its hat to those who put in more than 50% of their capacity, and stands on its head for those few and far between souls who devote 100%. Andrew Carnegie Work, World, Hat Lend your ears to music, open your eyes to painting, and... stop thinking! Just ask yourself whether the work has enabled you to 'walk about' into a hitherto unknown world. If the answer is yes, what more do you want? Wassily Kandinsky Work, Music, Eyes The bottom line is, when people are crystal clear about the most important priorities of the organization and team they work with and prioritized their work around those top priorities, not only are they many times more productive, they discover they have the time they need to have a whole life. Stephen Covey Life, Work, Time I think when you begin to think of yourself as having achieved something, then there's nothing left for you to work towards. I want to believe that there is a mountain so high that I will spend my entire life striving to reach the top of it. Cicely Tyson Life, Work, Mountain The main thing to do is relax and let your talent do the work. Charles Barkley Work, Relax, Talent Where the spirit does not work with the hand, there is no art. Leonardo da Vinci Work, Art, Spirit The miracle is not that we do this work, but that we are happy to do it. Mother Teresa Work, Happy, Miracle If you want to become a great chef, you have to work with great chefs. And that's exactly what I did. Gordon Ramsay Work, Great, Chef Whatever you wanna be, just, at the end of the day, if you're being a good person, which is not hard to be, and you're putting positive energy into the world, and you're appreciative and loving to the people around you that care about you and everybody in general, then it'll work out. Gnash Positive, Work, Day Create like a god, command like a king, work like a slave. Constantin Brancusi Work, God, King Plan your work for today and every day, then work your plan. Margaret Thatcher Work, Day, Today People who make the choice to study, work hard or do whatever they endeavor is to give it the max on themselves to reach to the top level. And you have the people who get envy and jealous, yet are not willing to put that work in, and they want to get the same praise. Evander Holyfield Work, Work Hard, Same Work hard. Through determination and self-focus and discipline, you can accomplish anything. Kimberly Guilfoyle Work, Determination Let me define a leader. He must have vision and passion and not be afraid of any problem. Instead, he should know how to defeat it. Most importantly, he must work with integrity. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Work, Integrity, Leader Don't worry about being a star, worry about doing good work, and all that will come to you. Ice Cube Work, Good, Worry While natural disasters capture headlines and national attention short-term, the work of recovery and rebuilding is long-term. Sylvia Mathews Burwell Work, Attention, Long-Term One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men. No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man. Elbert Hubbard Work, Technology, Man Our contribution purely depends on our consciousness and our willingness to support those in need, to show vulnerability and accept the support of others, to share without expecting the credit, to give it our all and allow our hard work to decide the outcome, to understand that control can only be achieved with a shared responsibility. Yehuda Berg Hard Work, Work, Support Live your life, do your work, then take your hat. Henry David Thoreau Life, Work, Hat I feel like a tiger right now. There's nothing impossible if you get up and work for it. Michael Flatley Work, Impossible, Tiger My advice to an aspiring actor would be to never stop learning or working for what you want. Nothing comes easy, ever, if you want something, you have to work for it. By working for it I mean work on your craft, learn from people who have something to teach. It's just like anything else, practice makes perfect. James Lafferty Work, Learning, Advice You aren't your work, your accomplishments, your possessions, your home, your family... your anything. You're a creation of your Source, dressed in a physical human body intended to experience and enjoy life on Earth. Wayne Dyer Life, Family, Work Capitalism is an organized system to guarantee that greed becomes the primary force of our economic system and allows the few at the top to get very wealthy and has the rest of us riding around thinking we can be that way, too - if we just work hard enough, sell enough Tupperware and Amway products, we can get a pink Cadillac. Michael Moore Work, Work Hard, Greed My mother lived through the Great Depression. Her family of 11 children pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and moved to wherever there was work at the time. And in rural Oklahoma, that wasn't easy to find. Chuck Norris Family, Work, Time It's true hard work never killed anybody, but I figure, why take the chance? Ronald Reagan Hard Work, Work, Chance When people see a legend, they call it a legend. But to be a legend, it's a lot of hard work and patience. You can't play for five or ten years and be a legend. It takes longer than that. Burning Spear Hard Work, Work, Patience I dress in my 'uniform,' or my own dress code, which reflects my personal method and work ethic. My belief is that my plain T-shirt - I have about 40 of them - or blue sweater helps focus others' attention on me and on what I say. Giorgio Armani Work, Focus, Work Ethic Respect your parents. What they tell you is true. Hard work, dedication and faith will get you anything. Imagination will drive itself. You can get anything you want, but you have to have faith behind all your ideas. Stick to your goals and have an undying faith. Russell Simmons Hard Work, Work, Faith Any product that needs a manual to work is broken. Elon Musk Work, Design, Broken Quality is pride of workmanship. W. Edwards Deming Work, Quality, Pride The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. Vince Lombardi Success, Work, Place People who work together will win, whether it be against complex football defenses, or the problems of modern society. Vince Lombardi Work, Football, Society If I don't feel confident about my body, I'm not going to sit at home and feel sorry for myself and not do something about it. It's all about taking action and not being lazy. So you do the work, whether it's fitness or whatever. It's about getting up, motivating yourself and just doing it. Kim Kardashian Work, Home, Fitness It's good to test yourself and develop your talents and ambitions as fully as you can and achieve greater success; but I think success is the feeling you get from a job well done, and the key thing is to do the work. Peter Thiel Success, Work, Good We are at our very best, and we are happiest, when we are fully engaged in work we enjoy on the journey toward the goal we've established for ourselves. It gives meaning to our time off and comfort to our sleep. It makes everything else in life so wonderful, so worthwhile. Earl Nightingale Life, Work, Time I work so hard to make that sure I'm successful. If you're positive and really excited and enthusiastic about what you're doing, it's going to happen, and it's going to happen big time. Shawn Mendes Positive, Work, Time Your ego can become an obstacle to your work. If you start believing in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity. Marina Abramovic Work, Death, Creativity I do not demand equal pay for any women save those who do equal work in value. Scorn to be coddled by your employers; make them understand that you are in their service as workers, not as women. Susan B. Anthony Work, Women, Service The best way to learn is by doing. The only way to build a strong work ethic is getting your hands dirty. Alex Spanos Work, Best, Strong An organization, no matter how well designed, is only as good as the people who live and work in it. Dee Hock Work, Business, Good I work hard. I focus on myself and putting food on my dinner table before anything else. I don't worry about other artists. Worrying about the next person in a negative way is the wrong way to be. Meek Mill Work, Food, Work Hard You only do good work when you're taking risks and pushing yourself. Sally Hawkins Work, Good, Taking Risks If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. Jim Rohn Work, Goals, Good Most people work just hard enough not to get fired and get paid just enough money not to quit. George Carlin Work, Money, People In American history, it's about hard work and self-reliance. It's not about collecting giveaways or being on unemployment forever. That the economy moves ahead for people who are going to work to realize the American dream, own a home, send your kids to college. I think it's the founding cornerstone of America. Ryan Zinke Hard Work, Work, Home Every great work, every big accomplishment, has been brought into manifestation through holding to the vision, and often just before the big achievement, comes apparent failure and discouragement.
