Hasty climbers have sudden falls. 
Italian Proverb

We are told never to cross a bridge until we come to it, but this world is owned by men who have crossed bridges in their imagination far ahead of the crowd. 
Anon.

When ambition ends, happiness begins. 
Proverb

Children, you must remember something. A man without ambition is dead. A man with ambition but no love is dead. A man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive. 
Pearl Bailey
Talking to Myself (1971)

Very few people are ambitious in the sense of having a specific image of what they want to achieve. Most peoples sights are only toward the next run, the next increment of money. 
Judith M. Bardwick

Ambition -- it is the last infirmity of noble minds. 
James Barrie

All ambitions are lawful except those that climb upward on the miseries or credulities of mankind. 
Henry Ward Beecher

Ambition. An overmastering desire to be vilified by enemies while living and made ridiculous by friends when dead. 
Ambrose Bierce

No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings. 
William Blake

Great ambition is the passion of a great character. Those endowed with it may perform very good or very bad acts. All depends on the principals which direct them. 
Napoleon Bonaparte

Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, youll land among the stars. 
Les Brown

What I aspired to be and was not, comforts me. 
Robert Browning

Tis not what man does which exalts him, but what man Would do! 
Robert Browning

Ambition is not what man does... but what man would do. 
Robert Browning

There are only two ways of getting on in the world: by ones own industry, or by the stupidity of others. 
Jean De La Bruyere

The slave has but one master, the ambitious man has as many as there are persons whose aid may contribute to the advancement of his fortunes. 
Jean De La Bruyere

Ambition can creep as well as soar. 
Edmund Burke

Like dogs in a wheel, birds in a cage, or squirrels in a chain, ambitious men still climb and climb, with great labor, and incessant anxiety, but never reach the top. 
Robert Burton

He who surpasses or subdues mankind, must look down on the hate of those below. 
Lord (George Gordon) Byron

As falls the dew on quenchless sands, blood only serves to wash ambitions hands. 
Lord (George Gordon) Byron

The men who succeed are the efficient few. They are the few who have the ambition and will power to develop themselves. 
Herbert N. Casson

It is commonly supposed that the art of pleasing is a wonderful aid in the pursuit of fortune; but the art of being bored is infinitely more successful. 
Sebastian Roch Nicolas Chamfort

Big results require big ambitions. 
James Champy

When you are aspiring to the highest place, it is honorable to reach the second or even the third rank. 
Marcus Tullius Cicero

<--ANGRY-->


If you are patient in one moment of anger, you will escape a hundred days of sorrow. 
Chinese Proverb

Anger is not only inevitable, but it is necessary. For in its place is indifference, the worst of all human qualities. 
Anon.

He who is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who has a hasty temper exalts folly. 
Proverb

There are two things a person should never be angry at, what they can help, and what they cannot. 
Proverb

No one is as angry as the person who is wrong. 
Proverb

The wrath of brothers is fierce and devilish. 
Proverb

Anger is as a stone cast into a wasps nest. 
Proverb

Indulge not thyself in the passion of anger; it is whetting a sword to wound thine own breast, or murder thy friend. 
Akhenaton

As the whirlwind in its fury teareth up trees, and deformeth the face of nature, or as an earthquake in its convulsions overturneth whole cities; so the rage of an angry man throweth mischief around him. 
Akhenaton

Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside. We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. And the harms we do, we do to ourselves. Mitch Albom
The Five People You Meet in Heaven

It takes two flints to make a fire. 
Louisa May Alcott

I used to store my anger and it affected my play. Now I get it out. Im never rude to my playing partner. Im very focused on the ball. Then its over. 
Helen Alfredsson

Men often make up in wrath what they want in reason. 
William R. Alger

I love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels. Lifes a bitch. Youve got to go out and kick ass. 
Maya Angelou

Bitterness is like cancer. It eats upon the host. But anger is like fire. It burns it all clean. 
Maya Angelou

Consider how much more you often suffer from your anger and grief, than from those very things for which you are angry and grieved. 
Marcus Antonius

Angry men are blind and foolish, for reason at such a time takes flight and, in her absence, wrath plunders all the riches of the intellect, while the judgment remains the prisoner of its own pride. 
Pietro Aretino

Anger is always concerned with individuals, whereas hatred is directed also against classes: we all hate any thief and any informer. Moreover, anger can be cured by time; but hatred cannot. The one aims at giving pain to its object, the other at doing him harm; the angry man wants his victim to feel; the hater does not mind whether they feel or not.
Aristotle

Anyone can become angry - that is easy. But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way; this is not easy. 
Aristotle

We praise a man who feels angry on the right grounds and against the right persons and also in the right manner at the right moment and for the right length of time. 
Aristotle

When thou art above measure angry, bethink thee how momentary is mans life. 
Marcus Aurelius

How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it. 
Marcus Aurelius

Anger cannot be dishonest. 
George R. Bach

Anger makes dull men witty but it keeps them poor.
Francis Bacon

Rage cannot be hidden, it can only be dissembled. This dissembling deludes the thoughtless, and strengthens rage and adds, to rage, contempt. 
James Baldwi

<--Architecture-->

A structure becomes architectural, and not sculptural, when its elements no longer have their justification in nature. 
Guillaume Apollinaire

In my experience, if you have to keep the lavatory door shut by extending your left leg, it s modern architecture. 
Nancy Banks-Smith

When it comes to getting things done, we need fewer architects and more bricklayers. 
Colleen C. Barrett

Where do architects and designers get their ideas? The answer, of course, is mainly from other architects and designers, so is it mere casuistry to distinguish between tradition and plagiarism? 
Stephen Bayley

Architect. One who drafts a plan of your house, and plans a draft of your money. 
Ambrose Bierce

Architecture is inhabited sculpture. 
Constantin Brancusi

You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe: when it knocked down our buildings it did not replace them with anything more offensive than rubble. We did that. 
Prince Of Wales Charles

All architecture is great architecture after sunset; perhaps architecture is really a nocturnal art, like the art of fireworks. 
G. K. Chesterton

A building is akin to dogma; it is insolent, like dogma. Whether or no it is permanent, it claims permanence, like a dogma. People ask why we have no typical architecture of the modern world, like impressionism in painting. Surely it is obviously because we have not enough dogmas; we cannot bear to see anything in the sky that is solid and enduring, anything in the sky that does not change like the clouds of the sky. 
G. K. Chesterton

The principle of the Gothic architecture is infinity made imaginable. 
Samuel Taylor Coleridge

In short, the building becomes a theatrical demonstration of its functional ideal. In this romanticism, high-tech architecture is, of course, no different in spirit -- if totally different in form -- from all the romantic architecture of the past. 
Dan Cruickshank

The terrifying and edible beauty of Art Nouveau architecture. 
Salvador Dali

The job of buildings is to improve human relations: architecture must ease them, not make them worse. 
Ralph Erskine

A bold architectural statement turns a public building into a landmark, but it is in the details where the architect becomes the real storyteller. 
Curtis W. Fentress

People actually ask me why I bring in projects on budget and on time. It seems I am not living up to the fashionable genius role. I really enjoy when a project gets down to the wire, and through sheer force of will and faith in our process, we cross the goal line, when most people thought it impossible. 
Curtis W. Fentress

There are many satisfactions in public architecture but one of the greatest is the moment when you unveil a project and suddenly a group of adults 
Curtis W. Fentress

Some architects have a preconceived notion of what a building should be 
Curtis W. Fentress

It takes a great client to create great architecture. 
Curtis W. Fentress

Our work is really about taking the best of what is in a place and working that into a project. We d like to take your vision and goals and weave that into all the bricks and mortar and steel and glass put together, along with all the functional things that we need to make the airport work better. 
Curtis W. Fentress

Don t fight forces, use them. 
Richard Buckminster Fuller

Light, God s eldest daughter, is a principal beauty in a building. 
Thomas Fuller

A modern, harmonic and lively architecture is the visible sign of an authentic democracy. 
Walter Gropius

Architects, painters, and sculptors must recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of a building both as an entity and in its separate parts. Only then will their work be imbued with the architectonic spirit which it has lost as salon art. Together let us desire, conceive, and create the new structure of the future, which will embrace architecture and sculpture and painting in one unity and which will one day rise toward heaven from the hands of a million workers like the crystal symbol of a new faith. 
Walter Gropius

The only legitimate artists in England are the architects. 
Benjamin Haydon

Architecture is to make us know and remember who we are. 
Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe

<--ART-->

Art is permitted to survive only if it renounces the right to be different, and integrates itself into the omnipotent realm of the profane. 
 Theodor Wiesengrund Adorno
 Art is an experience, not the formulation of a problem. 
 Lindsay Anderson
 Artists are, above all, men who want to become inhuman. 
 Guillaume Apollinaire
 Without poets, without artists, men would soon weary of nature s monotony. The sublime idea men have of the universe would collapse with dizzying speed. The order which we find in nature, and which is only an effect of art, would at once vanish. Everything would break up in chaos. There would be no seasons, no civilization, no thought, no humanity; even life would give way, and the impotent void would reign everywhere. 
 Guillaume Apollinaire
 Now the work of art also represents a state of final equilibrium, of accomplished order and maximum relative entropy, and there are those who resent it. But art is not meant to stop the stream of life. Within a narrow span of duration and space the work of art concentrates a view of the human condition; and sometimes it marks the steps of progression, just as a man climbing the dark stairs of a medieval tower assures himself by the changing sights glimpsed through its narrow windows that he is getting somewhere after all. 
 Rudolph Arnheim
 Art is a fruit that grows in man, like a fruit on a plant, or a child in its mother s womb. 
 Jean Arp
 Pictures and shapes are but secondary objects and please or displease only in the memory. 
 Francis Bacon
 The primary distinction of the artist is that he must actively cultivate that state which most men, necessarily, must avoid: the state of being alone. 
 James Baldwin
 All art is a kind of confession, more or less oblique. All artists, if they are to survive, are forced, at last, to tell the whole story; to vomit the anguish up. 
 James Baldwin
 The man who can but sketch his purpose beforehand in words is regarded as a wonder, and every artist and writer possesses that faculty. But gestation, fruition, the laborious rearing of the offspring, putting it to bed every night full fed with milk, embracing it anew every morning with the inexhaustible affection of a mother s heart, licking it clean, dressing it a hundred times in the richest garb only to be instantly destroyed; then never to be cast down at the convulsions of this headlong life till the living masterpiece is perfected which in sculpture speaks to every eye, in literature to every intellect, in painting to every memory, in music to every heart! --this is the task of execution. The hand must be ready at every moment to work in obedience to the mind. 
 Honore de Balzac
 If we could but paint with the hand what we see with the eye. 
 Honore de Balzac
 The first mistake of Art is to assume that it s serious. 
 Lester Bangs
 Every great work of art has two faces, one toward its own time and one toward the future, toward eternity. 
 Daniel Barenboim
 The essence of all art is to have pleasure in giving pleasure 
 Mikhail Baryshnikov
 Art distills sensations and embodies it with enhanced meaning. 
 Jacques Barzun
 A frenzied passion for art is a canker that devours everything else. 
 Charles Baudelaire
 The more a man cultivates the arts the less he fornicates. A more and more apparent cleavage occurs between the spirit and the brute. 
 Charles Baudelaire
 In order for the artist to have a world to express he must first be situated in this world, oppressed or oppressing, resigned or rebellious, a man among men. 
 Simone de Beauvoir
 Every artist dips his brush in his own soul, and paints his own nature into his pictures. 
 Henry Ward Beecher
 Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess? 
 Ludwig van Beethoven
 No one should drive a hard bargain with an artist. 
 Ludwig van Beethoven
 As for types like my own, obscurely motivated by the conviction that our existence was worthless if we didn t make a turning point of it, we were assigned to the humanities, to poetry, philosophy, painting -- the nursery games of humankind, which had to be left behind when the age of science began. The humanities would be called upon to choose a wallpaper for the crypt, as the end drew near. 
 Saul Bellow
 Any artist should be grateful for a na?ve grace which puts him beyond the need to reason elaborately. 
 Saul Bellow
 The greater the decrease in the social significance of an art form, the sharper the distinction between criticism and enjoyment by the public. The conventional is uncritically enjoyed, and the truly new is criticized with aversion. 
 Walter Benjamin
 The strange power of art is sometimes it can show that what people have in common is more urgent than what differentiates them. It seems to me it s something that theatre can do, but it s rare; it s very rare. 
 John Berger

 <ATTITUDE>

 Do not judge by appearances; a rich heart may be under a poor coat.
 Scottish Proverb
 Good nature is more agreeable in conversation than wit and gives a certain air to the countenance which is more amiable than beauty. 
 Joseph Addison
 Sometimes Im so sweet even I cant stand it. 
 Julie Andrews
 I got a simple rule about everybody. If you dont treat me right -- shame on you! 
 Louis Armstrong
 Life would be a perpetual flea hunt if a man were obliged to run down all the innuendoes, inveracities, and insinuations and misrepresentations which are uttered against him. 
 Henry Ward Beecher
 We are constantly being surprised that people did things well before we were born. We are constantly remarking on the fact that things are done well by people other than ourselves. The Japanese are a remarkable little people, we say, as if we were doing them a favor. He is an Arab, but you ought to hear him play the zither. Why but? 
 Robert Benchley
 Isnt It Remarkable?
 While we are focusing on fear, worry, or hate, it is not possible for us to be experiencing happiness, enthusiasm or love. 
 Bo Bennett
 There are no menial jobs, only menial attitudes.
 William John Bennett
 Whenever youre in conflict with someone, there is one factor that can make the difference between damaging your relationship and deepening it. That factor is attitude. 
 Timothy Bentley
 Id rather be a could-be if I cannot be an are;because a could-be is a maybe who is reaching for a star.Id rather be a has-been than a might-have-been, by far;for a might have-been has never been, but a has was once an are. 
 Milton Berle
 Life is 10 percent what you make it and 90 percent how you take it. 
 Irving Berlin
 It is better to know nothing than to know what aint so.

 Our attitudes control our lives. Attitudes are a secret power working twenty-four hours a day, for good or bad. It is of paramount importance that we know how to harness and control this great force. 
 Tom Blandi
 Feeling without judgement is a washy draught indeed; but judgement untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition. 
 Charlotte Bronte
 I never expect to lose. Even when Im the underdog, I still prepare a victory speech.

 You are more likely to act yourself into feelings, than feel yourself into action. 
 Jerome Bruner
 I dont wait for moods. You accomplish nothing if you do that. Your mind must know it has got to get down to earth. 
 Pearl Buck
 There are two big forces at work, external and internal. We have very little control over external forces such as tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, disasters, illness and pain. What really matters is the internal force. How do I respond to those disasters? Over that I have complete control. 
 Leo Buscaglia
 Attitudes are the forerunners of conditions.

Chris Evert
Its how you deal with failure that determines how you achieve success. 
David Feherty
Our attitude towards what has happened to us in life is the important thing to recognize. Once hopeless, my life is now hope-full, but it did not happen overnight. The last of human freedoms, to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances, is to choose ones own way.

Dupree Jordan
My attitude is never to be satisfied, never enough, never.
Bela Karolyi
Up to a point a mans life is shaped by environment, heredity, and the movements and changes in the world around him. Then there comes a time when it lies within his grasp to shape the clay of his life into the sort of thing he wishes to be. Only the weak blame parents, their race, their times, lack of good fortune, or the quirks of fate. Everyone has it within his power to say, This I am today; that I will be tomorrow. The wish, however, must be implemented by deeds.

Our attitude toward life determines lifes attitude towards us.
Earl Nightingale
A great attitude does much more than turn on the lights in our worlds; it seems to magically connect us to all sorts of serendipitous opportunities that were somehow absent before the change.
Earl Nightingale
Any fact facing us is not as important as our attitude toward it, for that determines our success or failure. The way you think about a fact may defeat you before you ever do anything about it. You are overcome by the fact because you think you are.
Norman Vincent Peale

There are, it has been said, two types of people in the world. There are those who, when presented with a glass that is exactly half-full, say: this glass is half full. And then there are those who say: this glass is half-empty. The world belongs, however, to those who can look at the glass and say: Whats up with this glass? Excuse me? Excuse me? This is my glass? I dont think so. My glass was full! And it was a bigger glass!

Pat Riley
We have unprecedented conditions to deal with and novel adjustments to make -- there can be no doubt of that. We also have a great stock of scientific knowledge unknown to our grandfathers with which to operate. So novel are the conditions, so copious the knowledge, that we must undertake the arduous task of reconsidering a great part of the opinions about man and his relations to his fellow men which have been handed down to us by previous generations who lived in far other conditions and possessed far less information about the world and themselves. We have, however, first to create an unprecedented attitude of mind to cope with unprecedented conditions, and to utilize unprecedented knowledge.
James H. Robinson
Ive always believed that you can think positive just as well as you can think negative.

Every exit is an entry somewhere.
Tom Stoppard
The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, the education, the money, than circumstances, than failure, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company... a church... a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past... we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our Attitudes.
Charles Swindoll
I believe the single most significant decision I can make on a day-to-day basis is my choice of attitude. It is more important than my past, my education, my bankroll, my successes or failures, fame or pain, what other people think of me or say about me, my circumstances, or my position. Attitude keeps me going or cripples my progress. It alone fuels my fire or assaults my hope. When my attitudes are right, there is no barrier too high, no valley too deep, no dream too extreme, no challenge too great for me.
Charles Swindoll
Words can never adequately convey the incredible impact of our attitudes toward life. The longer I live the more convinced I become that life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we respond to it.

I am an optimist, unrepentant and militant. After all, in order not to be a fool an optimist must know how sad a place the world can be. It is only the pessimist who finds this out anew every day.
Peter Ustinov
Our judgments judge us; and nothing reveals us or exposes our weaknesses more ingeniously than the attitude of pronouncing upon our fellows. 
Paul Ambroise Valery
Life is the movie you see through your own eyes. It makes little difference whats happening out there. Its how you take it that counts. 
Denis Waitley
There are things I cant force. I must adjust. There are times when the greatest change needed is a change of my viewpoint. 
C. M. Ward
Generalists, people with moderately strong attachments to many ideas, should be hard to interrupt, and once interrupted, should have weaker, shorter negative reactions since they have alternative paths to realize their plans. Specialists, people with stronger attachments to fewer ideas, should be easier to interrupt, and once interrupted, should have stronger, more sustained negative reactions because they have fewer alternative pathways to realize their plans. Generalists should be the upbeat, positive people in the profession while specialists should be their grouchy, negative counterparts. 
Karl Weick
Some men have thousands of reasons why they cannot do what they want to, when all they need is one reason why they can.

One ship drives east and other drives west by the same winds that blow. Its the set of the sails and not the gales that determines the way they go. 
Ella Wheeler Wilcox
Seriousness is the only refuge of the shallow. 
Oscar Wilde
The cynic knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. 
Oscar Wilde
Between the optimist and the pessimist, the difference is droll. The optimist sees the doughnut; the pessimist the hole! 
Mclandburgh Wilson
You can complain because roses have thorns, or you can rejoice because thorns have roses. 
Tom Wilson
Nothing will work unless you do. 
John Wooden
You cannot tailor make your situation in life, but you can tailor make your attitudes to fit those situations. 
Zig Ziglar
You cannot climb the ladder of success dressed in the costume of failure. 
Zig Ziglar
Positive thinking will let you do everything better than negative thinking will.

<BEAUTY>


A poor beauty finds more lovers than husbands. 
English Proverb
Beauty, unaccompanied by virtue, is as a flower without perfume. 
Proverb
The loveliest faces are to be seen by moonlight, when one sees half with the eye and half with the fancy. 
Proverb
Beauty is a good letter of introduction. 
Proverb
There is nothing that makes its way more directly to the soul than beauty. 
Joseph Addison
Let there be nothing within thee that is not very beautiful and very gentle, and there will be nothing without thee that is not beautiful and softened by the spell of thy presence. 
James Allen
....Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. He would never became vain or conceited, and would always remembered how it felt to be despised and teased, and he was very sorry for all the creatures who are so treated merely because they are different from those around them. Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, 
Hans Christian Andersen
What ever beauty may be, it has for its basis order, and for its essence unity. 
Father Andre
Beauty is one of the rare things that do not lead to doubt of God. 
Jean Anouilh
Things are beautiful if you love them. 
Jean Anouilh
Beauty is one of the rare things that do not lead to doubt of God. 
Jean Anouilh
Personal beauty is a greater recommendation than any letter of reference. 
Aristotle
Beauty depends on size as well as symmetry. No very small animal can be beautiful, for looking at it takes so small a portion of time that the impression of it will be confused. Nor can any very large one, for a whole view of it cannot be had at once, and so there will be no unity and completeness. 
Aristotle
Strange that the vanity which accompanies beauty --excusable, perhaps, when there is such great beauty, or at any rate understandable --should persist after the beauty was gone. 
Mary Arnim
The best part of beauty is that which no picture can express. 
Francis Bacon
There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion. 
Francis Bacon
Beauty is but the sensible image of the Infinite. Like truth and justice it lives within us; like virtue and the moral law it is a companion of the soul. 
George Bancroft
Beauty itself is but the sensible image of the infinite. 
George Bancroft
Im not ugly, but my beauty is a total creation. 
Tyra Banks
Beauty is desired in order that it may be befouled; not for its own sake, but for the joy brought by the certainty of profaning it. 
Georges Bataille
All forms of beauty, like all possible phenomena, contain an element of the eternal and an element of the transitory -- of the absolute and of the particular. Absolute and eternal beauty does not exist, or rather it is only an abstraction creamed from the general surface of different beauties. The particular element in each manifestation comes from the emotions: and just as we have our own particular emotions, so we have our own beauty. 
Charles Baudelaire
There are as many kinds of beauty as there are habitual ways of seeking happiness. 
Charles Baudelaire
The loveliest face in all the world will not please you if you see it suddenly eye to eye, at a distance of half an inch from your own. 
Max Beerbohm
The idea that happiness could have a share in beauty would be too much of a good thing. 
Walter Benjamin
Beauty is in the heart of the beholder. 
Al Bernstein
