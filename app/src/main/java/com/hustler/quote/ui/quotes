Our uniqueness makes us special, makes perception valuable
 but it can also make us lonely. This loneliness is different from being 'alone': You can be lonely even surrounded by people. The feeling I'm talking about stems from the sense that we can never fully share the truth of who we are. I experienced this acutely at an early age.

When you begin to worry, go find something to do. Get busy being a blessing to someone; do something fruitful.
