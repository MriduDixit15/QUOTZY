Hasty climbers have sudden falls. 
Italian Proverb

We are told never to cross a bridge until we come to it, but this world is owned by men who have crossed bridges in their imagination far ahead of the crowd. 
Anon.

When ambition ends, happiness begins. 
Proverb

Children, you must remember something. A man without ambition is dead. A man with ambition but no love is dead. A man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive. 
Pearl Bailey
Talking to Myself (1971)

Very few people are ambitious in the sense of having a specific image of what they want to achieve. Most peoples sights are only toward the next run, the next increment of money. 
Judith M. Bardwick

Ambition -- it is the last infirmity of noble minds. 
James Barrie

All ambitions are lawful except those that climb upward on the miseries or credulities of mankind. 
Henry Ward Beecher

Ambition. An overmastering desire to be vilified by enemies while living and made ridiculous by friends when dead. 
Ambrose Bierce

No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings. 
William Blake

Great ambition is the passion of a great character. Those endowed with it may perform very good or very bad acts. All depends on the principals which direct them. 
Napoleon Bonaparte

Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, youll land among the stars. 
Les Brown

What I aspired to be and was not, comforts me. 
Robert Browning

Tis not what man does which exalts him, but what man Would do! 
Robert Browning

Ambition is not what man does... but what man would do. 
Robert Browning

There are only two ways of getting on in the world: by ones own industry, or by the stupidity of others. 
Jean De La Bruyere

The slave has but one master, the ambitious man has as many as there are persons whose aid may contribute to the advancement of his fortunes. 
Jean De La Bruyere

Ambition can creep as well as soar. 
Edmund Burke

Like dogs in a wheel, birds in a cage, or squirrels in a chain, ambitious men still climb and climb, with great labor, and incessant anxiety, but never reach the top. 
Robert Burton

He who surpasses or subdues mankind, must look down on the hate of those below. 
Lord (George Gordon) Byron

As falls the dew on quenchless sands, blood only serves to wash ambitions hands. 
Lord (George Gordon) Byron

The men who succeed are the efficient few. They are the few who have the ambition and will power to develop themselves. 
Herbert N. Casson

It is commonly supposed that the art of pleasing is a wonderful aid in the pursuit of fortune; but the art of being bored is infinitely more successful. 
Sebastian Roch Nicolas Chamfort

Big results require big ambitions. 
James Champy

When you are aspiring to the highest place, it is honorable to reach the second or even the third rank. 
Marcus Tullius Cicero

<--ANGRY-->


If you are patient in one moment of anger, you will escape a hundred days of sorrow. 
Chinese Proverb

Anger is not only inevitable, but it is necessary. For in its place is indifference, the worst of all human qualities. 
Anon.

He who is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who has a hasty temper exalts folly. 
Proverb

There are two things a person should never be angry at, what they can help, and what they cannot. 
Proverb

No one is as angry as the person who is wrong. 
Proverb

The wrath of brothers is fierce and devilish. 
Proverb

Anger is as a stone cast into a wasps nest. 
Proverb

Indulge not thyself in the passion of anger; it is whetting a sword to wound thine own breast, or murder thy friend. 
Akhenaton

As the whirlwind in its fury teareth up trees, and deformeth the face of nature, or as an earthquake in its convulsions overturneth whole cities; so the rage of an angry man throweth mischief around him. 
Akhenaton

Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside. We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. And the harms we do, we do to ourselves. Mitch Albom
The Five People You Meet in Heaven

It takes two flints to make a fire. 
Louisa May Alcott

I used to store my anger and it affected my play. Now I get it out. Im never rude to my playing partner. Im very focused on the ball. Then its over. 
Helen Alfredsson

Men often make up in wrath what they want in reason. 
William R. Alger

I love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels. Lifes a bitch. Youve got to go out and kick ass. 
Maya Angelou

Bitterness is like cancer. It eats upon the host. But anger is like fire. It burns it all clean. 
Maya Angelou

Consider how much more you often suffer from your anger and grief, than from those very things for which you are angry and grieved. 
Marcus Antonius

Angry men are blind and foolish, for reason at such a time takes flight and, in her absence, wrath plunders all the riches of the intellect, while the judgment remains the prisoner of its own pride. 
Pietro Aretino

Anger is always concerned with individuals, whereas hatred is directed also against classes: we all hate any thief and any informer. Moreover, anger can be cured by time; but hatred cannot. The one aims at giving pain to its object, the other at doing him harm; the angry man wants his victim to feel; the hater does not mind whether they feel or not.
Aristotle

Anyone can become angry - that is easy. But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way; this is not easy. 
Aristotle

We praise a man who feels angry on the right grounds and against the right persons and also in the right manner at the right moment and for the right length of time. 
Aristotle

When thou art above measure angry, bethink thee how momentary is mans life. 
Marcus Aurelius

How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it. 
Marcus Aurelius

Anger cannot be dishonest. 
George R. Bach

Anger makes dull men witty but it keeps them poor.
Francis Bacon

Rage cannot be hidden, it can only be dissembled. This dissembling deludes the thoughtless, and strengthens rage and adds, to rage, contempt. 
James Baldwi

<--Architecture-->

A structure becomes architectural, and not sculptural, when its elements no longer have their justification in nature. 
Guillaume Apollinaire

In my experience, if you have to keep the lavatory door shut by extending your left leg, it s modern architecture. 
Nancy Banks-Smith

When it comes to getting things done, we need fewer architects and more bricklayers. 
Colleen C. Barrett

Where do architects and designers get their ideas? The answer, of course, is mainly from other architects and designers, so is it mere casuistry to distinguish between tradition and plagiarism? 
Stephen Bayley

Architect. One who drafts a plan of your house, and plans a draft of your money. 
Ambrose Bierce

Architecture is inhabited sculpture. 
Constantin Brancusi

You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe: when it knocked down our buildings it did not replace them with anything more offensive than rubble. We did that. 
Prince Of Wales Charles

All architecture is great architecture after sunset; perhaps architecture is really a nocturnal art, like the art of fireworks. 
G. K. Chesterton

A building is akin to dogma; it is insolent, like dogma. Whether or no it is permanent, it claims permanence, like a dogma. People ask why we have no typical architecture of the modern world, like impressionism in painting. Surely it is obviously because we have not enough dogmas; we cannot bear to see anything in the sky that is solid and enduring, anything in the sky that does not change like the clouds of the sky. 
G. K. Chesterton

The principle of the Gothic architecture is infinity made imaginable. 
Samuel Taylor Coleridge

In short, the building becomes a theatrical demonstration of its functional ideal. In this romanticism, high-tech architecture is, of course, no different in spirit -- if totally different in form -- from all the romantic architecture of the past. 
Dan Cruickshank

The terrifying and edible beauty of Art Nouveau architecture. 
Salvador Dali

The job of buildings is to improve human relations: architecture must ease them, not make them worse. 
Ralph Erskine

A bold architectural statement turns a public building into a landmark, but it is in the details where the architect becomes the real storyteller. 
Curtis W. Fentress

People actually ask me why I bring in projects on budget and on time. It seems I am not living up to the fashionable genius role. I really enjoy when a project gets down to the wire, and through sheer force of will and faith in our process, we cross the goal line, when most people thought it impossible. 
Curtis W. Fentress

There are many satisfactions in public architecture but one of the greatest is the moment when you unveil a project and suddenly a group of adults 
Curtis W. Fentress

Some architects have a preconceived notion of what a building should be 
Curtis W. Fentress

It takes a great client to create great architecture. 
Curtis W. Fentress

Our work is really about taking the best of what is in a place and working that into a project. We d like to take your vision and goals and weave that into all the bricks and mortar and steel and glass put together, along with all the functional things that we need to make the airport work better. 
Curtis W. Fentress

Don t fight forces, use them. 
Richard Buckminster Fuller

Light, God s eldest daughter, is a principal beauty in a building. 
Thomas Fuller

A modern, harmonic and lively architecture is the visible sign of an authentic democracy. 
Walter Gropius

Architects, painters, and sculptors must recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of a building both as an entity and in its separate parts. Only then will their work be imbued with the architectonic spirit which it has lost as salon art. Together let us desire, conceive, and create the new structure of the future, which will embrace architecture and sculpture and painting in one unity and which will one day rise toward heaven from the hands of a million workers like the crystal symbol of a new faith. 
Walter Gropius

The only legitimate artists in England are the architects. 
Benjamin Haydon

Architecture is to make us know and remember who we are. 
Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe

<--ART-->

Art is permitted to survive only if it renounces the right to be different, and integrates itself into the omnipotent realm of the profane. 
 Theodor Wiesengrund Adorno
 Art is an experience, not the formulation of a problem. 
 Lindsay Anderson
 Artists are, above all, men who want to become inhuman. 
 Guillaume Apollinaire
 Without poets, without artists, men would soon weary of nature s monotony. The sublime idea men have of the universe would collapse with dizzying speed. The order which we find in nature, and which is only an effect of art, would at once vanish. Everything would break up in chaos. There would be no seasons, no civilization, no thought, no humanity; even life would give way, and the impotent void would reign everywhere. 
 Guillaume Apollinaire
 Now the work of art also represents a state of final equilibrium, of accomplished order and maximum relative entropy, and there are those who resent it. But art is not meant to stop the stream of life. Within a narrow span of duration and space the work of art concentrates a view of the human condition; and sometimes it marks the steps of progression, just as a man climbing the dark stairs of a medieval tower assures himself by the changing sights glimpsed through its narrow windows that he is getting somewhere after all. 
 Rudolph Arnheim
 Art is a fruit that grows in man, like a fruit on a plant, or a child in its mother s womb. 
 Jean Arp
 Pictures and shapes are but secondary objects and please or displease only in the memory. 
 Francis Bacon
 The primary distinction of the artist is that he must actively cultivate that state which most men, necessarily, must avoid: the state of being alone. 
 James Baldwin
 All art is a kind of confession, more or less oblique. All artists, if they are to survive, are forced, at last, to tell the whole story; to vomit the anguish up. 
 James Baldwin
 The man who can but sketch his purpose beforehand in words is regarded as a wonder, and every artist and writer possesses that faculty. But gestation, fruition, the laborious rearing of the offspring, putting it to bed every night full fed with milk, embracing it anew every morning with the inexhaustible affection of a mother s heart, licking it clean, dressing it a hundred times in the richest garb only to be instantly destroyed; then never to be cast down at the convulsions of this headlong life till the living masterpiece is perfected which in sculpture speaks to every eye, in literature to every intellect, in painting to every memory, in music to every heart! --this is the task of execution. The hand must be ready at every moment to work in obedience to the mind. 
 Honore de Balzac
 If we could but paint with the hand what we see with the eye. 
 Honore de Balzac
 The first mistake of Art is to assume that it s serious. 
 Lester Bangs
 Every great work of art has two faces, one toward its own time and one toward the future, toward eternity. 
 Daniel Barenboim
 The essence of all art is to have pleasure in giving pleasure 
 Mikhail Baryshnikov
 Art distills sensations and embodies it with enhanced meaning. 
 Jacques Barzun
 A frenzied passion for art is a canker that devours everything else. 
 Charles Baudelaire
 The more a man cultivates the arts the less he fornicates. A more and more apparent cleavage occurs between the spirit and the brute. 
 Charles Baudelaire
 In order for the artist to have a world to express he must first be situated in this world, oppressed or oppressing, resigned or rebellious, a man among men. 
 Simone de Beauvoir
 Every artist dips his brush in his own soul, and paints his own nature into his pictures. 
 Henry Ward Beecher
 Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess? 
 Ludwig van Beethoven
 No one should drive a hard bargain with an artist. 
 Ludwig van Beethoven
 As for types like my own, obscurely motivated by the conviction that our existence was worthless if we didn t make a turning point of it, we were assigned to the humanities, to poetry, philosophy, painting -- the nursery games of humankind, which had to be left behind when the age of science began. The humanities would be called upon to choose a wallpaper for the crypt, as the end drew near. 
 Saul Bellow
 Any artist should be grateful for a na?ve grace which puts him beyond the need to reason elaborately. 
 Saul Bellow
 The greater the decrease in the social significance of an art form, the sharper the distinction between criticism and enjoyment by the public. The conventional is uncritically enjoyed, and the truly new is criticized with aversion. 
 Walter Benjamin
 The strange power of art is sometimes it can show that what people have in common is more urgent than what differentiates them. It seems to me it s something that theatre can do, but it s rare; it s very rare. 
 John Berger

 <ATTITUDE>

 Do not judge by appearances; a rich heart may be under a poor coat.
 Scottish Proverb
 Good nature is more agreeable in conversation than wit and gives a certain air to the countenance which is more amiable than beauty. 
 Joseph Addison
 Sometimes Im so sweet even I cant stand it. 
 Julie Andrews
 I got a simple rule about everybody. If you dont treat me right -- shame on you! 
 Louis Armstrong
 Life would be a perpetual flea hunt if a man were obliged to run down all the innuendoes, inveracities, and insinuations and misrepresentations which are uttered against him. 
 Henry Ward Beecher
 We are constantly being surprised that people did things well before we were born. We are constantly remarking on the fact that things are done well by people other than ourselves. The Japanese are a remarkable little people, we say, as if we were doing them a favor. He is an Arab, but you ought to hear him play the zither. Why but? 
 Robert Benchley
 Isnt It Remarkable?
 While we are focusing on fear, worry, or hate, it is not possible for us to be experiencing happiness, enthusiasm or love. 
 Bo Bennett
 There are no menial jobs, only menial attitudes.
 William John Bennett
 Whenever youre in conflict with someone, there is one factor that can make the difference between damaging your relationship and deepening it. That factor is attitude. 
 Timothy Bentley
 Id rather be a could-be if I cannot be an are;because a could-be is a maybe who is reaching for a star.Id rather be a has-been than a might-have-been, by far;for a might have-been has never been, but a has was once an are. 
 Milton Berle
 Life is 10 percent what you make it and 90 percent how you take it. 
 Irving Berlin
 It is better to know nothing than to know what aint so.

 Our attitudes control our lives. Attitudes are a secret power working twenty-four hours a day, for good or bad. It is of paramount importance that we know how to harness and control this great force. 
 Tom Blandi
 Feeling without judgement is a washy draught indeed; but judgement untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition. 
 Charlotte Bronte
 I never expect to lose. Even when Im the underdog, I still prepare a victory speech.

 You are more likely to act yourself into feelings, than feel yourself into action. 
 Jerome Bruner
 I dont wait for moods. You accomplish nothing if you do that. Your mind must know it has got to get down to earth. 
 Pearl Buck
 There are two big forces at work, external and internal. We have very little control over external forces such as tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, disasters, illness and pain. What really matters is the internal force. How do I respond to those disasters? Over that I have complete control. 
 Leo Buscaglia
 Attitudes are the forerunners of conditions.

Chris Evert
Its how you deal with failure that determines how you achieve success. 
David Feherty
Our attitude towards what has happened to us in life is the important thing to recognize. Once hopeless, my life is now hope-full, but it did not happen overnight. The last of human freedoms, to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances, is to choose ones own way.

Dupree Jordan
My attitude is never to be satisfied, never enough, never.
Bela Karolyi
Up to a point a mans life is shaped by environment, heredity, and the movements and changes in the world around him. Then there comes a time when it lies within his grasp to shape the clay of his life into the sort of thing he wishes to be. Only the weak blame parents, their race, their times, lack of good fortune, or the quirks of fate. Everyone has it within his power to say, This I am today; that I will be tomorrow. The wish, however, must be implemented by deeds.

Our attitude toward life determines lifes attitude towards us.
Earl Nightingale
A great attitude does much more than turn on the lights in our worlds; it seems to magically connect us to all sorts of serendipitous opportunities that were somehow absent before the change.
Earl Nightingale
Any fact facing us is not as important as our attitude toward it, for that determines our success or failure. The way you think about a fact may defeat you before you ever do anything about it. You are overcome by the fact because you think you are.
Norman Vincent Peale

There are, it has been said, two types of people in the world. There are those who, when presented with a glass that is exactly half-full, say: this glass is half full. And then there are those who say: this glass is half-empty. The world belongs, however, to those who can look at the glass and say: Whats up with this glass? Excuse me? Excuse me? This is my glass? I dont think so. My glass was full! And it was a bigger glass!

Pat Riley
We have unprecedented conditions to deal with and novel adjustments to make -- there can be no doubt of that. We also have a great stock of scientific knowledge unknown to our grandfathers with which to operate. So novel are the conditions, so copious the knowledge, that we must undertake the arduous task of reconsidering a great part of the opinions about man and his relations to his fellow men which have been handed down to us by previous generations who lived in far other conditions and possessed far less information about the world and themselves. We have, however, first to create an unprecedented attitude of mind to cope with unprecedented conditions, and to utilize unprecedented knowledge.
James H. Robinson
Ive always believed that you can think positive just as well as you can think negative.

Every exit is an entry somewhere.
Tom Stoppard
The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, the education, the money, than circumstances, than failure, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company... a church... a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past... we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our Attitudes.
Charles Swindoll
I believe the single most significant decision I can make on a day-to-day basis is my choice of attitude. It is more important than my past, my education, my bankroll, my successes or failures, fame or pain, what other people think of me or say about me, my circumstances, or my position. Attitude keeps me going or cripples my progress. It alone fuels my fire or assaults my hope. When my attitudes are right, there is no barrier too high, no valley too deep, no dream too extreme, no challenge too great for me.
Charles Swindoll
Words can never adequately convey the incredible impact of our attitudes toward life. The longer I live the more convinced I become that life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we respond to it.

I am an optimist, unrepentant and militant. After all, in order not to be a fool an optimist must know how sad a place the world can be. It is only the pessimist who finds this out anew every day.

C. M. Ward
Generalists, people with moderately strong attachments to many ideas, should be hard to interrupt, and once interrupted, should have weaker, shorter negative reactions since they have alternative paths to realize their plans. Specialists, people with stronger attachments to fewer ideas, should be easier to interrupt, and once interrupted, should have stronger, more sustained negative reactions because they have fewer alternative pathways to realize their plans. Generalists should be the upbeat, positive people in the profession while specialists should be their grouchy, negative counterparts.

Some men have thousands of reasons why they cannot do what they want to, when all they need is one reason why they can.

<BEAUTY>


A poor beauty finds more lovers than husbands. 
English Proverb
Beauty, unaccompanied by virtue, is as a flower without perfume. 
Proverb
The loveliest faces are to be seen by moonlight, when one sees half with the eye and half with the fancy. 
Proverb
Beauty is a good letter of introduction. 
Proverb
There is nothing that makes its way more directly to the soul than beauty. 
Joseph Addison
Let there be nothing within thee that is not very beautiful and very gentle, and there will be nothing without thee that is not beautiful and softened by the spell of thy presence. 
James Allen
....Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. He would never became vain or conceited, and would always remembered how it felt to be despised and teased, and he was very sorry for all the creatures who are so treated merely because they are different from those around them. Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, 
Hans Christian Andersen
What ever beauty may be, it has for its basis order, and for its essence unity. 
Father Andre
Beauty is one of the rare things that do not lead to doubt of God. 
Jean Anouilh
Things are beautiful if you love them. 
Jean Anouilh
Beauty is one of the rare things that do not lead to doubt of God. 
Jean Anouilh
Personal beauty is a greater recommendation than any letter of reference. 
Aristotle
Beauty depends on size as well as symmetry. No very small animal can be beautiful, for looking at it takes so small a portion of time that the impression of it will be confused. Nor can any very large one, for a whole view of it cannot be had at once, and so there will be no unity and completeness. 
Aristotle
Strange that the vanity which accompanies beauty --excusable, perhaps, when there is such great beauty, or at any rate understandable --should persist after the beauty was gone. 
Mary Arnim
The best part of beauty is that which no picture can express. 
Francis Bacon
There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion. 
Francis Bacon
Beauty is but the sensible image of the Infinite. Like truth and justice it lives within us; like virtue and the moral law it is a companion of the soul. 
George Bancroft
Beauty itself is but the sensible image of the infinite. 
George Bancroft
Im not ugly, but my beauty is a total creation. 
Tyra Banks
Beauty is desired in order that it may be befouled; not for its own sake, but for the joy brought by the certainty of profaning it. 
Georges Bataille
All forms of beauty, like all possible phenomena, contain an element of the eternal and an element of the transitory -- of the absolute and of the particular. Absolute and eternal beauty does not exist, or rather it is only an abstraction creamed from the general surface of different beauties. The particular element in each manifestation comes from the emotions: and just as we have our own particular emotions, so we have our own beauty. 
Charles Baudelaire
There are as many kinds of beauty as there are habitual ways of seeking happiness. 
Charles Baudelaire
The loveliest face in all the world will not please you if you see it suddenly eye to eye, at a distance of half an inch from your own. 
Max Beerbohm
The idea that happiness could have a share in beauty would be too much of a good thing. 
Walter Benjamin
Beauty is in the heart of the beholder. 
Al Bernstein

To believe a thing is impossible is to make it so.
Proverb

And if we now cast our eyes over the nations of the earth, we shall find that, instead of possessing the pure religion of the Gospel, they may be divided either into infidels, who deny the truth; or politicians who make religion a stalking horse for their ambition; or professors, who walk in the trammels of orthodoxy, and are more attentive to traditions and ordinances of men than to the oracles of truth.
Samuel Adams

The will to do springs from the knowledge that we can do.
James Allen

Our systems, perhaps, are nothing more than an unconscious apology for our faults --a gigantic scaffolding whose object is to hide from us our favorite sin.

It doesn't matter how many say it cannot be done or how many people have tried it before; it's important to realize that whatever you're doing, it's your first attempt at it.
Wally Amos

Maya Angelou

If you don't change your beliefs, your life will be like this forever. Is that good news?
Dr. Robert Anthony

Saint Bartholomew

The essential element in personal magnetism is a consuming sincerity -- an overwhelming faith in the importance of the work one has to do.
Bruce Barton

When you think of the huge uninterrupted success of a book like Don Quixote, you're bound to realize that if humankind have not yet finished being revenged, by sheer laughter, for being let down in their greatest hope, it is because that hope was cherished so long and lay so deep!
Georges Bernanos

Everything is possible for him who believes.

One of my less pleasant chores when I was young was to read the Bible from one end to the other. Reading the Bible straight through is at least 70 percent discipline, like learning Latin. But the good parts are, of course, simply amazing. God is an extremely uneven writer, but when He's good, nobody can touch Him.
John W. Gardner

If they had a social gospel in the days of the prodigal son, somebody would have given him a bed and a sandwich and he never would have gone home.
Vance Havner

It is Christ Himself, not the Bible, who is the true word of God. The Bible, read in the right spirit and with the guidance of good teachers, will bring us to Him. We must not use the Bible as a sort of encyclopedia out of which texts can be taken for use as weapons.
C.S. Lewis

The glory of the gospel is that when the church is absolutely different from the world, she invariably attracts it.
David Martyn Lloyd-Jones

The gospel to me is simply irresistible.
Blaise Pascal

The gospel is neither a discussion or a debate. It is an announcement.
Paul S. Rees

Each generation of the church in each setting has the responsibility of communicating the gospel in understandable terms, considering the language and thought-forms of that setting.
Francis Schaeffer

Philosophical argument has sometimes shaken my reason for the faith that was in me; but my heart has always assured me that the Gospel of Jesus Christ must be reality.
Daniel Webster

<BOOKS>25

Books are the legacies that a great genius leaves to mankind, which are delivered down from generation to generation as presents to the posterity of those who are yet unborn.
Joseph Addison

Books that have become classics -- books that have had their day and now get more praise than perusal -- always remind me of retired colonels and majors and captains who, having reached the age limit, find themselves retired on half pay.
Thomas Bailey Aldrich

Literature is made upon any occasion that a challenge is put to the legal apparatus by conscience in touch with humanity.
Nelson Algren

The writer in western civilization has become not a voice of his tribe, but of his individuality. This is a very narrow-minded situation.
Aharon Appelfeld

If the most significant characteristic of man is the complex of biological needs he shares with all members of his species, then the best lives for the writer to observe are those in which the role of natural necessity is clearest, namely, the lives of the very poor.
W. H. Auden

Literary imagination is an aesthetic object offered by a writer to a lover of books.
Gaston Bachelard

Literature is without proofs. By which it must be understood that it cannot prove, not only what it says, but even that it is worth the trouble of saying it.
Roland Barthes

In the present age, alas! our pens are ravished by unlettered authors and unmannered critics, that make a havoc rather than a building, a wilderness rather than a garden. But, a lack! what boots it to drop tears upon the preterit?
Aubrey Beardsley

Do not worry about the incarnation of ideas. If you are a poet, your works will contain them without your knowledge -- they will be both moral and national if you follow your inspiration freely.

Child! Do not throw this book about Refrain from the unholy pleasureOf cutting all the pictures out!Preserve it as your chiefest treasure.
Hilaire Belloc
dedication to The Bad Child's Book of Beasts (1896)

The naturalistic literature of this country has reached such a state that no family of characters is considered true to life which does not include at least two hypochondriacs, one sadist, and one old man who spills food down the front of his vest.
Robert Benchley

The book borrower...proves himself to be an inveterate collector of books not so much by the fervor with which he guards his borrowed treasures...as by his failure to read these books.

Unpacking My Library, 1931

Definition of a classic: a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have.
Alan Bennett

The great standard of literature as to purity and exactness of style is the Bible.
Hugh Blair

There are certain books in the world which every searcher for truth must know: the Bible, the Critique of Pure Reason, the Origin of Species, and Karl Marx's Capital.
W. E. B. Du Bois

Literature is not exhaustible, for the sufficient and simple reason that a single book is not. A book is not an isolated entity: it is a narration, an axis of innumerable narrations. One literature differs from another, either before or after it, not so much because of the text as for the manner in which it is read.
Jorge Luis Borges

A losing trade, I assure you, sir: literature is a drug.
George Borrow

No one is fit to judge a book until he has rounded Cape Horn in a sailing vessel, until he has bumped into two or three icebergs, until he has been lost in the sands of the desert, until he has spent a few years in the House of the Dead.
Van Wyck Brooks
From a Writer's Notebook, 1958

All literature is political.
LeVar Burton

English literature is a kind of training in social ethics. English trains you to handle a body of information in a way that is conducive to action.
Marilyn Butler

The struggle of literature is in fact a struggle to escape from the confines of language; it stretches out from the utmost limits of what can be said; what stirs literature is the call and attraction of what is not in the dictionary.
Italo Calvino

When politicians and politically minded people pay too much attention to literature, it is a bad sign -- a bad sign mostly for literature. But it is also a bad sign when they don't want to hear the word mentioned.
Italo Calvino

A classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say.
Italo Calvino

There is a great discovery still to be made in literature, that of paying literary men by the quantity they do not write.
Thomas Carlyle

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, and what is the use of a book thought Alice, without pictures or conversations?
Lewis Carroll

Some have been thought brave because they didn't have the courage to run away.
Proverb

Courage and perseverance have a magical talisman, before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air.
John Quincy Adams

Courage that grows from constitution often forsakes a man when he has occasion for it; courage which arises from a sense of duty acts ;in a uniform manner.

Freda Adler

It is easy to be brave from a safe distance.
Aesop

Aristotle

The beauty of the soul shines out when a man bears with composure one heavy mischance after another, not because he does not feel them, but because he is a man of high and heroic temper.
Aristotle

Boldness is ever blind, for it sees not dangers and inconveniences whence it is bad in council though good in execution.
Francis Bacon

The brave man is not he who feels no fear, For that were stupid and irrational; But he, whose noble soul its fears subdues, And bravely dares the danger nature shrinks from.

Be daring, be different, be impractical, be anything that will assert integrity of purpose and imaginative vision against the play-it-safers, the creatures of the commonplace, the slaves of the ordinary.

Don't open a shop unless you like to smile.
Chinese Proverb

The go-between wears out a thousand sandals.
Japanese Proverb

Instead of focusing on their individual agendas, collaborative partnerships establish common goals. In order to address problems that lie beyond any single agency's exclusive purview, but which concern them all, partners agree to pool resources, jointly plan, implement, and evaluate new services and procedures, and delegate individual responsibility for the outcomes of their joint efforts.

In a cat's eye, all things belong to cats.
English Proverb

One of the problems of taking things apart and seeing how they work - supposing you're trying to find out how a cat works--you take that cat apart to see how it works, what you've got in your hands is a non-working cat.

Both ardent lovers and austere scholars, when once they come to the years of discretion, love cats, so strong and gentle, the pride of the household, who like them are sensitive to the cold, and sedentary.
Charles Baudelaire

A lion, for instance, which in nature is not a very distinctive object, was portrayed, for greater distinction, with its leonine attributes, its fierce expression, frightful claws, lithe and ,lissom body all vastly exaggerated, so that indeed it looked more like a lion than did ever any lion of nature. In this wise, by turning away from true representation and adopting a character all its own, was the 'heraldic lion' born, and with it came also the manner of depictin all the other beasts and forms and patterns which is so peculiarly heraldic.

If a cat spoke, it would say things like Hey, I don't see the problem here.

Lewis Carroll

I said something which gave you to think I hated cats. But gad, sir, I am one of the most fanatical cat lovers in the business. If you hate them, I may learn to hate you. If your allergies hate them, I will tolerate the situation to the best of my ability.

Your rat tail is all the fashion now. I prefer a bushy plume, carried straight up. You are Siamese and your ancestors lived in trees. Mine lived in palaces. It has been suggested to me that I am a bit of a snob. How true! I prefer to be.

An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life:
A fight is going on inside me, he said to the boy. It is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves. One is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other is good - he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. This same fight is going on inside you - and inside every other person, too.
The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather,Which wolf will win?

The worst thing about the miracle of modern communications is the Pavlovian pressure it places upon everyone to communicate whenever a bell rings.
Russell Baker
No Cause for Pain, "Times (London)", November 28, 1991

The marriage of reason and nightmare which has dominated the 20th century has given birth to an ever more ambiguous world. Across the communications landscape move the specters of sinister technologies and the dreams that money can buy.

Bruce Burton

That must be wonderful; I have no idea of what it means.
Albert Camus

The idea that Bill Gates has appeared like a knight in shining armor to lead all customers out of a mire of technological chaos neatly ignores the fact that it was he who, by peddling second- rate technology, led them into it in the first place.

The word user is the word used by the computer professional when they mean idiot.
Dave Barry

The sad thing about artificial intelligence is that it lacks artifice and therefore intelligence.
Jean Baudrillard

Computer science only indicates the retrospective omnipotence of our technologies. In other words, an infinite capacity to process data (but only data -- i.e. the already given) and in no sense a new vision. With that science, we are entering an era of exhaustivity, which is also an era of exhaustion.
Jean Baudrillard

The most likely way for the world to be destroyed, most experts agree, is by accident. That's where we come in; we're computer professionals. We cause accidents.

Edward Albee

Whatever creativity is, it is in part a solution to a problem. 
Brian W. Aldiss

Had I been present at the creation of the world I would have proposed some improvements. 
Alfonso X

The creative person wants to be a know -it -all. He wants to know about all kinds of things: ancient history, nineteenth -century mathematics, current manufacturing techniques, flower arranging, and hog futures. Because he never knows when these ideas might come together to form a new idea. It may happen six minutes later or six months, or six years down the road. But he has faith that it will happen.

Ray Bradbury

Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
Robert Bresson

I set out to show that there exists single creative activity,which is displayed alike in the arts and in the sciences.It is wrong to think of science as a mechanical record of facts, and it is wrong to think of the arts as remote and private fancies. What makes each human, what makes them universal, is the stamp of the creative mind. 
Jacob Bronowski
Science and Human Values (Ch.2 - The Habit of Truth)

The good ideas are all hammered out in agony by individuals, not spewed out by groups. 
Charles Browder

Creativity comes from trust. Trust your instincts. And never hope more than you work. 
Rita Mae Brown

The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this: a human creature born abnormally, inhumanly sensitive. To him, a touch is a blow, a sound is a noise, a misfortune is a tragedy, a joy is an ecstasy, a friend is a lover, a lover is a god, and failure is death. Add to this cruelly delicate organism the overpowering necessity to create, create, create - so that without the creating of music or poetry or books or buildings or something of meaning, his very breath is cut off from him. He must create, must pour out creation. By some strange, unknown, inward urgency he is not really alive unless he is creating. 
Pearl Buck

The human mind cannot create anything. It produces nothing until after having been fertilized by experience and meditation; its acquisitions are the gems of its production. 
Georges-Louis Leclerc Buffon

It is better to create than to learn! Creating is the essence of life.

He who is false to present duty breaks a thread in the loom, and will find the flaw when he may have forgotten its cause.
Henry Ward Beecher

Duty. That which sternly impels us in the direction of profit, along the line of desire.
Ambrose Bierce

Do the duty which lies nearest to you, the second duty will then become clearer.
Thomas Carlyle

Our duty, as men and women, is to proceed as if limits to our ability did not exist. We are collaborators in creation.
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin

When one has come to accept a certain course as duty he has a pleasant sense of relief and of lifted responsibility, even if the course involves pain and renunciation. It is like obedience to some external authority; any clear way, though it lead to death, is mentally preferable to the tangle of uncertainty.
Charles Horton Cooley

The right thing to do never requires any subterfuge, it is always simple and direct.
Calvin Coolidge

Do your duty and leave the rest to heaven.

The reward of one's duty is the power to fulfill another.
George Eliot

A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.
Douglas Adams

Interior design is a travesty of the architectural process and a frightening condemnation of the credulity, helplessness and gullibility of the most formidable consumers
Stephen Bayley

Why kick the man downstream who can't put the parts together because the parts really weren't designed properly?
Philip Caldwell

Perhaps believing in good design is like believing in God, it makes you an optimist.

ARCHITECTURE, n: The art of how to waste space.

Design in art, is a recognition of the relation between various things, various elements in the creative flux. You can't invent a design. You recognize it, in the fourth dimension. That is, with your blood and your bones, as well as with your eyes.
D. H. (David Herbert) Lawrence

Design is not for philosophy -- it's for life.

Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space.
Mies Van der Rohe

In architecture as in all other operative arts, the end must direct the operation. The end is to build well. Well building has three conditions: Commodity, Firmness and Delight.
Henry Watton

The complaint about modern steel furniture, modern glass houses, modern red bars and modern streamlined trains and cars is that all these objets modernize, while adequate and amusing in themselves, tend to make the people who use them look dated. It is an honest criticism. The human race has done nothing much about changing its own appearance to conform to the form and texture of its appurtenances.
E.B. (Elwyn Brooks) White

Noble life demands a noble architecture for noble uses of noble men. Lack of culture means what it has always meant: ignoble civilization and therefore imminent downfall.

Designs in connection with postage stamps and coinage may be described, I think, as the silent ambassadors on national taste.

Outside every fat man there was an even fatter man trying to close in.

Greg Anderson

I don't weigh a pound over one hundred and eighty and, what's more, I never did.
Fatty Arbuckle

The obese is in a total delirium. For he is not only large, of a size opposed to normal morphology: he is larger than large. He no longer makes sense in some distinctive opposition, but in his excess, his redundancy.
Jean Baudrillard

Probably nothing in the world arouses more false hopes Than the first four hours of a diet.

St. Jerome

They whose sole bliss is eating can give but that one brutish reason why they live.

Some people are born to fatness. Others have to get there.
Les Murray

Chinese Proverb

If you want your dreams to come true, don't over sleep.

Matthew Arnold

When asked what he would do if he only had six months to live: Type faster.

A daydream is a meal at which images are eaten. Some of us are gourmets, some gourmands, and a good many take their images precooked out of a can and swallow them down whole, absent-mindedly and with little relish. 
W. H. Auden

Reverie is not a mind vacuum. It is rather the gift of an hour which knows the plenitude of the soul. 
Gaston Bachelard

Dreams have only the pigmentation of fact. 
Djuna Barnes

Let sleep itself be an exercise in piety, for such as our life and conduct have been, so also of necessity will be our dreams. 
St. Basil

For in the end it is Middle-Earth and its dwellers that we love, not Tolkien's considerable gifts in showing it to us. I said once that the world he charts was there long before him, and I still believe it. He is a great enough magician to tap our most common nightmares, daydreams and twilight fancies, but he never invented them either: he found them a place to live, a green alternative to each day's madness here in a poisoned world. We are raised to honor all the wrong explorers and discoverers - thieves planting flags, murderers carrying crosses. Let us at last praise the colonizers of dreams. 
Peter S. Beagle

Who so regardeth dreams is like him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind. Ecclesiasticus 34:2 
Bible

America has been a land of dreams. A land where the aspirations of people from countries cluttered with rich, cumbersome, aristocratic, ideological pasts can reach for what once seemed unattainable. Here they have tried to make dreams come true. Yet now... we are threatened by a new and particularly American menace. It is not the menace of class war, of ideology, of poverty, of disease, of illiteracy, or demagoguery, or of tyranny, though these now plague most of the world. It is the menace of unreality. 
Daniel J. Boorstin

I don't feel right unless I have a sport to play or at least a way to work up a sweat.
Hank Aaron

The human condition is such that pain and effort are not just symptoms which can be removed without changing life itself; they are the modes in which life itself, together with the necessity to which it is bound, makes itself felt. For mortals, the easy life of the gods would be a lifeless life.

Education is a companion which no misfortune can depress, no crime can destroy, no enemy can alienate,no despotism can enslave. At home, a friend, abroad, an introduction, in solitude a solace and in society an ornament.It chastens vice, it guides virtue, it gives at once grace and government to genius. Without it, what is man? A splendid slave, a reasoning savage.
Joseph Addison

What sculpture is to a block of marble, education is to an human soul.
Joseph Addison

Life is my college. May I graduate well, and earn some honors.
Louisa May Alcott

Education helps one case cease being intimidated by strange situations.
Maya Angelou

The quality of strength lined with tenderness is an unbeatable combination, as are intelligence and necessity when unblunted by formal education.
Maya Angelou

If all the rich and all of the church people should send their children to the public schools they would feel bound to concentrate their money on improving these schools until they met the highest ideals.
Susan B. Anthony

Repeticio est mater studiorum.
Thomas Aquinas

I was allowed to ring the bell for five minutes until everyone was in assembly. It was the beginning of power.

To be sure, nothing is more important to the integrity of the universities than a rigorously enforced divorce from war-oriented research and all connected enterprises.
Hannah Arendt

Education is the best provision for old age.
Aristotle

The educated differ from the uneducated as much as the living from the dead.
Aristotle

Those who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce them; for these only gave them life, those the art of living well.
Aristotle

Education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity.
Aristotle

The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.
Aristotle

Home of lost causes, and forsaken beliefs, and unpopular names, and impossible loyalties!
Matthew Arnold

What we must look for here is, firstly, religious and moral principles; secondly, gentlemanly conduct; thirdly, intellectual ability.
Thomas Arnold

The race of prophets is extinct. Europe is becoming set in its ways, slowly embalming itself beneath the wrappings of its borders, its factories, its law-courts and its universities. The frozen Mind cracks between the mineral staves which close upon it. The fault lies with your moldy systems, your logic of 2 + 2 = 4. The fault lies with you, Chancellors, caught in the net of syllogisms. You manufacture engineers, magistrates, doctors, who know nothing of the true mysteries of the body or the cosmic laws of existence. False scholars blind outside this world, philosophers who pretend to reconstruct the mind. The least act of spontaneous creation is a more complex and revealing world than any metaphysics.
Antonin Artaud

Essentialists hope that when students leave school, they will possess not only basic skills and an extensive body of knowledge, but also disciplined, practical minds, capable of applying schoolhouse lessons in the real world.
William C. Bagley

The paradox of education is precisely this -- that as one begins to become conscious one begins to examine the society in which he is being educated.
James Baldwin

It is very nearly impossible... to become an educated person in a country so distrustful of the independent mind.
James Baldwin

A child cannot be taught by anyone who despises him, and a child cannot afford to be fooled.
James Baldwin

Education is the knowledge of how to use the whole of oneself. Many men use but one or two faculties out of the score with which they are endowed. A man is educated who knows how to make a tool of every faculty--how to open it, how to keep it sharp, and how to apply it to all practical purposes.
Henry Ward Beecher



A man is not rightly conditioned until he is a happy, healthy, and prosperous being; and happiness, health, and prosperity are the result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer of the man with his surroundings.
James Allen

The first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself.
Mark Caine

People blame their environment. There is only one person to blame -- and only one -- themselves.
Robert Collier

Man shapes himself through decision that shape his environment.
Ren

Every man is like the company he is wont to keep.
Euripides

When we become a part of anything, it becomes a part of us.
David Harold Fink

We are on the precipice of climate system tipping points beyond which there is no redemption.
James Hansen

We begin to see, therefore, the importance of selecting our environment with the greatest of care, because environment is the mental feeding ground out of which the food that goes into our minds is extracted.
Napoleon Hill

A person is either the effect of his environment or is able to have an effect upon his environment.
L. Ron Hubbard

A strong, successful man is not the victim of his environment. He creates favorable conditions. His own inherent force and energy compel things to turn out as he desires.
Orison Swett Marden

Every experience in life, everything with which we have come in contact in life, is a chisel which has been cutting away at our life statue, molding, modifying, shaping it. We are part of all we have met. Everything we have seen, heard, felt or thought has had its hand in molding us, shaping us.
Orison Swett Marden

We make the world we live in and shape our own environment.
Orison Swett Marden

Your outlook upon life, your estimate of yourself, your estimate of your value are largely colored by your environment. Your whole career will be modified, shaped, molded by your surroundings, by the character of the people with whom you come in contact every day...
Orison Swett Marden

Our environment, the world in which we live and work, is a mirror of our attitudes and expectations.
Earl Nightingale

We are the environment.
Charles Panati

We live in a web of ideas, a fabric of our own making.
Joseph Chilton Pearce

We are shaped by each other. We adjust not to the reality of a world, but to the reality of other thinkers.
Joseph Chilton Pearce

We found that the most exciting environments, that treated people very well, are also tough as nails. There is no bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo... excellent companies provide two things simultaneously: tough environments and very supportive environments.
Thomas J. Peters

It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it.
Dan Quayle

You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success -- or are they holding you back?
W. Clement Stone




Perfect love cannot be without equality.
Scottish Proverb

Choose your friends by their character and your socks by their color. Choosing your socks by their character makes no sense, and choosing your friends by their color is unthinkable.
Anon.

Six feet of earth make all men equal.
Proverb

You cannot have all chiefs; you gotta have Indians too.
Proverb

A friend to everybody and to nobody is the same thing.
Proverb

Divine Justice demands that the rights of both sexes should be equally respected since neither is superior to the other in the eyes of Heaven. Dignity before God depends, not on sex, but on purity and luminosity of heart. Human virtues belong equally to all!
Abdu'l-Baha Paris Talks

Women have been trained to speak softly and carry a lipstick. Those days are over.
Bella Abzug

The test for whether or not you can hold a job should not be the arrangement of your chromosomes.
Bella Abzug

By nature all men are equal in liberty, but not in other endowments.
Thomas Aquinas

The beginning of reform is not so much to equalize property as to train the noble sort of natures not to desire more, and to prevent the lower from getting more.
Aristotle

Equality consists in the same treatment of similar persons.
Aristotle

The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal.
Aristotle

When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?
John Ball

Equality may perhaps be a right, but no power on earth can ever turn it into a fact.
Honore de Balzac

The most mediocre of males feels himself a demigod as compared with women.
Simone de Beauvoir

We've got a generation now who were born with semi equality. They don't know how it was before, so they think, this isn't too bad. We're working. We have our attache cases and our three piece suits. I get very disgusted with the younger generation of women. We had a torch to pass, and they are just sitting there. They don't realize it can be taken away. Things are going to have to get worse before they join in fighting the battle.
Erma Bombeck

There has to be positive action that allows the most disadvantaged people to get their fair share of job opportunities.
Paul Burton

We accept and welcome... as conditions to which we must accommodate ourselves, great inequality of environment; the concentration of business, industrial and commercial, in the hands of a few; and the law of competition between these, as being not only beneficial, but essential for the future progress of the race.
Andrew Carnegie

My grandma (rest her soul) used to say, There were but two families in the world, have-much and have-little.

Minna Antrim

Experience is a private, and a very largely speechless affair. 
James Baldwin

Experience that destroys innocents also leads one back to it. 
James Baldwin

You should make a point of trying every experience once, excepting incest and folk dancing. 
Arnold Bax

Our days are a kaleidoscope. Every instant a change takes place in the contents. New harmonies, new contrasts, new combinations of every sort. Nothing ever happens twice alike. The most familiar people stand each moment in some new relation to each other, to their work, to surrounding objects. The most tranquil house, with the most serene inhabitants, living upon the utmost regularity of system, is yet exemplifying infinite diversities. 
Henry Ward Beecher

Experience is determined by yourself -- not the circumstances of your life. 
Gita Bellin

Only he who can view his own past as an abortion sprung from compulsion and need can use it to full advantage in the present. For what one has lived is at best comparable to a beautiful statue which has had all its limbs knocked off in transit, and now yields nothing but the precious block out of which the image of one's future must be hewn. 
Walter Benjamin

Bad experience is a school that only fools keep going to. 
Ezra Taft Benson

Experience is a revelation in the light of which we renounce our errors of youth for those of age. 
Ambrose Bierce

Experience. The wisdom that enables us to recognize in an undesirable old acquaintance the folly that we have already embraced. 
Ambrose Bierce

Experience is a school where a man learns what a big fool he has been. 
Josh Billings

Experience increases our wisdom but doesn't reduce our follies. 
Josh Billings

There is nothing so easy to learn as experience and nothing so hard to apply. 
Josh Billings

Few people even scratch the surface, much less exhaust the contemplation of their own experience. 
Randolph Silliman Bourne

Experience isn't interesting until it begins to repeat itself. In fact, till it does that, it hardly is experience. 
Elizabeth Bowen

Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal well meaning but without understanding. 
Louis D. Brandeis

Experience, like a pale musician, holds a dulcimer of patience in his hand. 
Elizabeth Barrett Browning

I do not accept any absolute formulas for living. No preconceived code can see ahead to everything that can happen in a man's life. As we live, we grow and our beliefs change. They must change. So I think we should live with this constant discovery. We should be open to this adventure in heightened awareness of living. We should stake our whole existence on our willingness to explore and experience. 
Martin Buber

I reached in experience the nirvana which is unborn, unrivalled, secure from attachment, undecaying and unstained. This condition is indeed reached by me which is deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, tranquil, excellent, beyond the reach of mere logic, subtle, and to be realized only by the wise. 
Buddha




Do not look where you fell, but where you slipped.
African Proverb

Everyone pushes a falling fence.
Chinese Proverb

The great question is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with failure.
Chinese Proverb

When someone is going downhill everyone likes to give them a kick.
Proverb

Who has never tasted what is bitter does not know what is sweet.
Proverb

No matter how far you have gone on a wrong road, turn back.
Proverb

I have always felt that although someone may defeat me, and I strike out in a ball game, the pitcher on the particular day was the best player. But I know when I see him again, I'm going to be ready for his curve ball. Failure is a part of success. There is no such thing as a bed of roses all your life. But failure will never stand in the way of success if you learn from it.
Hank Aaron

The typical human life seems to be quite unplanned, undirected, unlived, and unsavored. Only those who consciously think about the adventure of living as a matter of making choices among options, which they have found for themselves, ever establish real self-control and live their lives fully.
Karl Albrecht

They fail, and they alone, who have not striven.
Thomas Bailey Aldrich

There are few things more dreadful than dealing with a man who knows he is going under, in his own eyes, and in the eyes of others. Nothing can help that man. What is left of that man flees from what is left of human attention.
James Baldwin

We are all failures -- at least, all the best of us are.
James Barrie

If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.
Steve Bartkowski

We pay just as dearly for our triumphs as we do for our defeats. Go ahead and fail. But fail with wit, fail with grace, fail with style. A mediocre failure is as insufferable as a mediocre success. Embrace failure! Seek it out. Learn to love it. That may be the only way any of us will ever be free. Tom Robbins Before you give up hope, turn back and read the attacks that were made on Lincoln.
Bruce Barton

I wasn't afraid to fail. Something good always comes out of failure.

My downfall raises me to infinite heights.
Napoleon Bonaparte

No one ever won a chess game by betting on each move. Sometimes you have to move backward to get a step forward.
Amar Gopal Bose

Nothing fails like success because we don't learn from it. We learn only from failure.
Kenneth Ewart Boulding

A failure establishes only this, that our determination to succeed was not strong enough.
Christian Nevell Bovee

To win you've got to stay in the game.
Claude M. Bristol

You must think of failure and defeat as the springboards to new achievements or to the next level of accomplishment.
Les Brown

Failure is an event, never a person.
William D. Brown


The mark of your ignorance is the depth of your belief in injustice and tragedy. What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the master calls a butterfly.
Anon.

Weave in faith and God will find the thread.
Proverb

A person consists of his faith. Whatever is his faith, even so is he.
Proverb

Faith is a continuation of reason.
William Adams

In faith and hope the world will disagree, But all mankind's concern is charity.
Alexander The Great

Where faith is there is courage, there is fortitude, there is steadfastness and strength... Faith bestows that sublime courage that rises superior to the troubles and disappointments of life, that acknowledges no defeat except as a step to victory; that is strong to endure, patient to wait, and energetic to struggle... Light up, then, the lamp of faith in your heart... It will lead you safely through the mists of doubt and the black darkness of despair; along the narrow, thorny ways of sickness and sorrow, and over the treacherous places of temptation and uncertainty.
James Allen

Faith has to do with things that are not seen, and hope with things that are not in hand.
Thomas Aquinas

If we become completely whole-hearted we will have love for all people and will seek in each person what is most holy, what God has inspired in him or her. And only then will there be no danger of softening or twisting our witness. Why? Because the capacity of our faith will no longer be narrow. If we are not broadhearted, we have not yet grasped the meaning of faith. We must always be ready to be newly led in our faith, even through the tiniest atom of godliness we find in others. It is that which leads us to the kingdom of God. We affirm that there is something of God in all people -- something of the light. It may only gleam now, but it will eventually lead to complete illumination.
Eberhard Arnold

May it not be that, just as we have to have faith in Him, God has to have faith in us and, considering the history of the human race so far, may it not be that faith is even more difficult for Him than it is for us?
W. H. Auden

In order to be a realist you must believe in miracles.
Henry Christopher Bailey

Faith is a higher faculty than reason.
Henry Christopher Bailey

You don't decide to build a church because you have money in the bank. You build because God says this is what I should do. Faith is the supplier of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.
Jim Bakker

The ablest men in all walks of modern life are men of faith. Most of them have much more faith than they themselves realize.
Bruce Barton

Faith without works is like a bird without wings; though she may hop with her companions on earth, yet she will never fly with them to heaven.
Francis Beaumont

Our faith in the present dies out long before our faith in the future.
Ruth Benedict

Faith is not a thing which one loses, we merely cease to shape our lives by it.
Georges Bernanos

I believe though I do not comprehend, and I hold by faith what I cannot grasp with the mind.
St. Bernard

Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. Hebrews 11:1
Bible

All things are possible to him who believes. Mark 9:23
Bible

According to your faith; be it done unto you.
Bible

And without faith it is impossible to please him, for he who comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him. Hebrews 11:6
Bible

If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. Mark 9:23
Bible

For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
Bible

Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you. Peter 3:15
Bible

For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made... Romans 1:20

One of life's greatest mysteries is how the boy who wasn't good enough to marry your daughter can be the father of the smartest grandchild in the world.
Yiddish Proverb

When a father gives to his son, both laugh; when a son gives to his father, both cry.
Yiddish Proverb

A friend who is near and dear may in time become as useless as a relative.
George Ade

The family is the school of duties... founded on love.
Felix Adler

A farmer who had a quarrelsome family called his sons and told them to lay a bunch of sticks before him. Then, after laying the sticks parallel to one another and binding them, he challenged his sons, one after one, to pick up the bundle and break it. They all tried, but in vain. Then, untying the bundle, he gave them the sticks to break one by one. This they did with the greatest ease. Then said the father, Thus, my sons, as long as you remain united, you are a match for anything, but differ and separate, and you are undone.
Aesop

Our notion of the perfect society embraces the family as its center and ornament, and this paradise is not secure until children appear to animate and complete the picture.
Amos Bronson Alcott

Even as the cell is the unit of the organic body, so the family is the unit of society.
Ruth Nanda Anshen

Love, by reason of its passion, destroys the in-between which relates us to and separates us from others. As long as its spell lasts, the only in-between which can insert itself between two lovers is the child, love's own product. The child, this in-between to which the lovers now are related and which they hold in common, is representative of the world in that it also separates them; it is an indication that they will insert a new world into the existing world. Through the child, it is as though the lovers return to the world from which their love had expelled them. But this new worldliness, the possible result and the only possibly happy ending of a love affair, is, in a sense, the end of love, which must either overcome the partners anew or be transformed into another mode of belonging together.
Hannah Arendt

Cruel is the strife of brothers.
Aristotle

Rarely do members of the same family grow up under the same roof.
Richard Bach

He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief.
Francis Bacon

You leave home to seek your fortune and, when you get it, you go home and share it with your family.

The babe at first feeds upon the mother's bosom, but it is always on her heart.

There is no friendship, no love, like that of the parent for the child.
Henry Ward Beecher

Family jokes, though rightly cursed by strangers, are the bond that keeps most families alive.
Stella Benson

He followed in his father's footsteps, but his gait was somewhat erratic.
Nicolas Bentley

A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle. Proverbs 18:19
Bible

You hear a lot of dialogue on the death of the American family. Families aren't dying. They're merging into big conglomerates.
Erma Bombeck




A father is a banker provided by nature.
Proverb

Certain is it that there is no kind of affection so purely angelic as of a father to a daughter. In love to our wives there is desire; to our sons, ambition; but to our daughters there is something which there are no words to express.
Joseph Addison

That he delights in the misery of others no man will confess, and yet what other motive can make a father cruel?
Joseph Addison

Sir Walter, being strangely surprised and put out of his countenance at so great a table, gives his son a damned blow over the face. His son, as rude as he was, would not strike his father, but strikes over the face the gentleman that sat next to him and said Box about: twill come to my father anon.
John Aubrey

A father is always making his baby into a little woman. And when she is a woman he turns her back again.
Enid Bagnold

If the relationship of father to son could really be reduced to biology, the whole earth would blaze with the glory of fathers and sons.
James Baldwin

Call no man your father upon the earth, for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
Bible

Fathers do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. Ephesians 6:4
Bible

When God was creating fathers, He started with a tall frame. An angel nearby said, What kind of father is that? If you
Erma Bombeck

Those who have never had a father can at any rate never know the sweets of losing one. To most men the death of his father is a new lease of life.
Samuel Butler

As fathers commonly go, it is seldom a misfortune to be fatherless; and considering the general run of sons, as seldom a misfortune to be childless.
Lord Chesterfield

Blessed indeed is the man who hears many gentle voices call him father!
Lydia Maria Child

The father who does not teach his son his duties is equally guilty with the son who neglects them.
Confucius

Father...knows exactly what those boys at the mall have in their depraved little minds because he once owned such a depraved little mind himself. In fact, if he thinks enough about the plans that he used to have for young girls, the father not only will support his wife in keeping their daughter home but he might even run over to the mall and have a few of those boys arrested.
Bill Cosby

If the new American father feels bewildered and even defeated, let him take comfort from the fact that whatever he does in any fathering situation has a fifty percent chance of being right.
Bill Cosby

You know, fathers just have a way of putting everything together.
Erika Cosby

Be kind to thy father, for when thou were young, who loved thee so fondly as he? He caught the first accents that fell from thy tongue, and joined in thy innocent glee.
Margaret Courtney

In peace the sons bury their fathers, but in war the fathers bury their sons.
Croesus

I watched a small man with thick calluses on both hands work fifteen and sixteen hours a day. I saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms of his feet, a man who came here uneducated, alone, unable to speak the language, who taught me all I needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example.
Mario Cuomo

What a dreadful thing it must be to have a dull father.
Mary Mapes Dodge

I believe that what we become depends on what our fathers teach us at odd moments, when they aren't trying to teach us.

To a father growing old nothing is dearer than a daughter.
Euripides

I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a father's protection.
Sigmund Freud

To be a successful father... there's one absolute rule: when you have a kid, don't look at it for the first two years.
Ernest Hemingway


Fear less, hope more; eat less, chew more; whine less breathe more; talk less, say more; hate less, love more; and all good things are yours.
Swedish Proverb

According to legend, one day a man was wandering in the desert when he met Fear and Plague. They said they were on their way to a large city where they were going to kill 10,000 people. The man asked Plague if he was going to do all the work. Plague smiled and said, No, I'll only take care of a few hundred. I'll let my friend Fear do the rest.
Anon.

He who fears to suffer, suffers from fear.
Proverb

That fear may reach all, punish but few.
Proverb

A scalded cat dreads cold water.

People always make the wolf more formidable than he is.

As the ostrich when pursued hideth his head, but forgetteth his body; so the fears of a coward expose him to danger.
Akhenaton

People are only mean when they're threatened, and that's what our culture does. That's what our economy does.
Mitch Albom

It is not a matter of being fearless. The fear is sometimes constant, but it's about moving forward regardless of the fear. Courage means feeling the fear and doing it anyway.
Gillian Anderson

Fear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.
Marian Anderson

An ugly sight, a man who is afraid.
Jean Anouilh

Come to the edge, He said. They said, We are afraid. Come to the edge, He said. They came. He pushed them... and they flew.
Guillaume Apollinaire

Every time you win, it diminishes the fear a little bit. You never really cancel the fear of losing; you keep challenging it.
Arthur Ashe

It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.
Marcus Aurelius

You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.
Jane Austen

Men fear death as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other.
Francis Bacon

It is a miserable state of mind to have few things to desire and many things to fear.
Francis Bacon

At man's core there is a voice that wants him never to give in to fear. But if it is true that in general man cannot give in to fear, at the very least he postpones indefinitely the moment when he will have to confront himself with the object of his fear... when he will no longer have the assistance of reason as guaranteed by God, or when he will no longer have the assistance of God such as reason guaranteed. It is necessary to recoil, but it is necessary to leap, and perhaps one only recoils in order to leap better.
Georges Bataille

Fear is not a good teacher. The lessons of fear are quickly forgotten.
Mary Catherine Bateson

Terror is as much a part of the concept of truth as runniness is of the concept of jam. We wouldn't like jam if it didn't, by its very nature, ooze. We wouldn't like truth if it wasn't sticky, if, from time to time, it didn't ooze blood.
Jean Baudrillard

Fear secretes acids; but love and trust are sweet juices.
Henry Ward Beecher

Fear is met and destroyed with courage.

Talk of joy: there may be things better than beef stew and baked potatoes and home-made bread -- there may be.
Ray Stannard Baker [David Grayson]

I would like to find a stew that will give me heartburn immediately, instead of at three o clock in the morning.
John Barrymore

Public and private food in America has become eatable, here and there extremely good. Only the fried potatoes go unchanged, as deadly as before.
Luigi Barzini

They eat the dainty food of famous chefs with the same pleasure with which they devour gross peasant dishes, mostly composed of garlic and tomatoes, or fisherman's octopus and shrimps, fried in heavily scented olive oil on a little deserted beach.
Luigi Barzini

Sadder than destitution, sadder than a beggar is the man who eats alone in public. Nothing more contradicts the laws of man or beast, for animals always do each other the honor of sharing or disputing each other's food.
Jean Baudrillard

A gourmet who thinks of calories is like a tart, who looks at her watch.
James Beard

Only the pure in heart can make a good soup.
Ludwig van Beethoven

Taking food alone tends to make one hard and coarse. Those accustomed to it must lead a Spartan life if they are not to go downhill. Hermits have observed, if for only this reason, a frugal diet. For it is only in company that eating is done justice; food must be divided and distributed if it is to be well received.
Walter Benjamin

Yogi ordered a pizza. The waitress asked How many pieces do you want your pie cut? Yogi responded, Four. I don't think I could eat eight.
Yogi Berra

Put a knife to thy throat, if you're a man given to appetite.
Bible

Proverb

Mishkat Al-masabih

In contrast to revenge, which is the natural, automatic reaction to transgression and which, because of the irreversibility of the action process can be expected and even calculated, the act of forgiving can never be predicted; it is the only reaction that acts in an unexpected way and thus retains, though being a reaction, something of the original character of action.
Hannah Arendt

Bad men are full of repentance.
Aristotle

Forgive many things in others; nothing in yourself.
Decimus Magnus Ausonius

They who forgive most shall be most forgiven.
Josiah Bailey

The best thing to give to your enemy is forgiveness; to an opponent, tolerance; to a friend, your heart; to your child, a good example; to a father, deference; to your mother, conduct that will make her proud of you; to yourself, respect; to all men, charity.
Arthur Balfour

I never forgive, but I always forget.
Arthur Balfour

Every man should keep a fair-sized cemetery in which to bury the faults of his friends.

Henry Ward Beecher

God pardons like a mother, who kisses the offense into everlasting forgiveness.
Henry Ward Beecher

I can forgive, but I cannot forget, is only another way of saying, I will not forgive. Forgiveness ought to be like a canceled note -- torn in two, and burned up, so that it never can be shown against one.
Henry Ward Beecher

I can forgive, but I cannot forget, is only another way of saying, I cannot forgive.
Henry Ward Beecher

Repentance is another name for aspiration.
Henry Ward Beecher

The saving man becomes the free man.
Chinese Proverb

Liberty, according to my metaphysics is a self-determining power in an intellectual agent. It implies thought and choice and power.
John Adams

Yesterday the greatest question was decided which ever was debated in America; and a greater perhaps never was, nor will be, decided among men. A resolution was passed without one dissenting colony, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States.
John Adams

When people talk of the freedom of writing, speaking or thinking I cannot choose but laugh. No such thing ever existed. No such thing now exists; but I hope it will exist. But it must be hundreds of years after you and I shall write and speak no more.
John Adams

Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.
John Adams

If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, go home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen.
Samuel Adams, speech at the Philadelphia State House, August 1, 1776

Freedom is the emancipation from the arbitrary rule of other men.
Mortimer J. Adler

When we were told that by freedom we understood free enterprise, we did very little to dispel this monstrous falsehood. Wealth and economic well-being, we have asserted, are the fruits of freedom, while we should have been the first to know that this kind of happiness has been an unmixed blessing only in this country, and it is a minor blessing compared with the truly political freedoms, such as freedom of speech and thought, of assembly and association, even under the best conditions.
Hannah Arendt

Man cannot be free if he does not know that he is subject to necessity, because his freedom is always won in his never wholly successful attempts to liberate himself from necessity.
Hannah Arendt

Democracy arose from men's thinking that if they are equal in any respect, they are equal absolutely.
Aristotle

Within yourself deliverance must be searched for, because each man makes his own prison.
Sir Edwin Arnold

A nation which makes the final sacrifice for life and freedom does not get beaten.
Kemal Ataturk

The fly that touches honey cannot use it's wings; so too the soul that clings to spiritual sweetness ruins it's freedom and hinders contemplation.
Ghose Aurobindo

The most intellectual of men are moved quite as much by the circumstances which they are used to as by their own will. The active voluntary part of a man is very small, and if it were not economized by a sleepy kind of habit, its results would be null.
Walter Bagehot

Any honest examination of the national life proves how far we are from the standard of human freedom with which we began. The recovery of this standard demands of everyone who loves this country a hard look at himself, for the greatest achievements must begin somewhere, and they always begin with the person. If we are not capable of this examination, we may yet become one of the most distinguished and monumental failures in the history of nations.
James Baldwin

The oppression of any people for opinion's sake has rarely had any other effect than to fix those opinions deeper, and render them more important.
Hosea Ballou

Freedom all solace to man gives: He lives at ease that freely lives.
John Barbour

What a curious phenomenon it is that you can get men to die for the liberty of the world who will not make the little sacrifice that is needed to free themselves from their own individual bondage.
Bruce Barton

The greatest blessing of our democracy is freedom. But in the last analysis, our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves.
Bernard Baruch

In the last analysis, our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves.
Bernard Baruch

The liberated man is not the one who is freed in his ideal reality, his inner truth, or his transparency; he is the man who changes spaces, who circulates, who changes sex, clothes, and habits according to fashion, rather than morality, and who changes opinions not as his conscience dictates but in response to opinion polls.
Jean Baudrillard

As for freedom, it will soon cease to exist in any shape or form. Living will depend upon absolute obedience to a strict set of arrangements, which it will no longer be possible to transgress. The air traveler is not free. In the future, life's passengers will be even less so: they will travel through their lives fastened to their (corporate) seats.
Jean Baudrillard

You need only reflect that one of the best ways to get yourself a reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is to go about repeating the very phrases which our founding fathers used in the struggle for independence.
Charles Austin Beard

True obedience is true freedom.
Henry Ward Beecher

There are always risks in freedom. The only risk in bondage is breaking free.
Gita Bellin

Marcus Aurelius

The future is... black. 
James Baldwin

Pop artists deal with the lowly trivia of possessions and equipment that the present generation is lugging along with it on its safari into the future. 
J. G. Ballard

I would sum up my fear about the future in one word: boring. And that's my one fear: that everything has happened; nothing exciting or new or interesting is ever going to happen again... the future is just going to be a vast, conforming suburb of the soul. 
J. G. Ballard

It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future. 
Yogi Berra

I have a Vision of the Future, chum. The workers flats in fields of soya beans tower up like silver pencils, score on score. 
John Betjeman

Ambrose Bierce

William Blake

The future destiny of the child is always the work of the mother. 
Napoleon Bonaparte

In answer to your inquiry, I consider that the chief dangers which confront the coming century will be religion without the Holy Ghost, Christianity without Christ, forgiveness without repentance, salvation without regeneration, politics without God, and heaven without hell.

Merelene Cornish

It is my belief that whereas the twentieth century has been a century of war and untold suffering, the twenty-first century should be one of peace and dialogue. As the continued advances in information technology make our world a truly global village, I believe there will come a time when war and armed conflict will be considered an outdated and obsolete method of settling differences among nations and communities. 
Dalai Lama
