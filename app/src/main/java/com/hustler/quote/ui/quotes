It is not the menace of class war of ideology of poverty of disease of illiteracy or demagoguery or of tyranny though these now plague most of the world. It is the menace of unreality.
Daniel J. Boorstin

Education is a companion which no misfortune can depress no crime can destroy no enemy can alienateno despotism can enslave.

Thomas Arnold

The race of prophets is extinct. Europe is becoming set in its ways slowly embalming itself beneath the wrappings of its borders its factories its law courts and its universities. The frozen Mind cracks between the mineral staves which close upon it. The fault lies with your moldy systems your logic of 2 + 2 = 4. The fault lies with you Chancellors caught in the net of syllogisms. You manufacture engineers magistrates doctors who know nothing of the true mysteries of the body or the cosmic laws of existence. False scholars blind outside this world philosophers who pretend to reconstruct the mind. The least act of spontaneous creation is a more complex and revealing world than any metaphysics.
Antonin Artaud

Essentialists hope that when students leave school they will possess not only basic skills and an extensive body of knowledge but also disciplined practical minds capable of applying schoolhouse lessons in the real world.

James Allen

Faith has to do with things that are not seen and hope with things that are not in hand.
Thomas Aquinas

If we become completely whole hearted we will have love for all people and will seek in each person what is most holy what God has inspired in him or her. And only then will there be no danger of softening or twisting our witness. Why? Because the capacity of our faith will no longer be narrow. If we are not broadhearted we have not yet grasped the meaning of faith. We must always be ready to be newly led in our faith even through the tiniest atom of godliness we find in others. It is that which leads us to the kingdom of God. We affirm that there is something of God in all people something of the light. It may only gleam now but it will eventually lead to complete illumination.
Eberhard Arnold

May it not be that just as we have to have faith in Him God has to have faith in us and considering the history of the human race so far may it not be that faith is even more difficult for Him than it is for us?

Amos Bronson Alcott

Even as the cell is the unit of the organic body so the family is the unit of society.
Ruth Nanda Anshen

Love by reason of its passion destroys the in between which relates us to and separates us from others. As long as its spell lasts the only in between which can insert itself between two lovers is the child loves own product. The child this in between to which the lovers now are related and which they hold in common is representative of the world in that it also separates them it is an indication that they will insert a new world into the existing world. Through the child it is as though the lovers return to the world from which their love had expelled them. But this new worldliness the possible result and the only possibly happy ending of a love affair is in a sense the end of love which must either overcome the partners anew or be transformed into another mode of belonging together.
Hannah Arendt

It is a miserable state of mind to have few things to desire and many things to fear.

At mans core there is a voice that wants him never to give in to fear. But if it is true that in general man cannot give in to fear at the very least he postpones indefinitely the moment when he will have to confront himself with the object of his fear  when he will no longer have the assistance of reason as guaranteed by God or when he will no longer have the assistance of God such as reason guaranteed. It is necessary to recoil but it is necessary to leap and perhaps one only recoils in order to leap better.
Georges Bataille

Fear is not a good teacher. The lessons of fear are quickly forgotten.

When we were told that by freedom we understood free enterprise we did very little to dispel this monstrous falsehood.

Only God can shape a flower but any foolish child can pull it to pieces.

 Just as there is nothing between the admirable omelet and the intolerable so with autobiography.
 Hilaire Belloc

 Reminiscences even extensive ones do not always amount to an autobiography. For autobiography has to do with time with sequence and what makes up the continuous flow of life. Here I am talking of a space of moments and discontinuities. For even if months and years appear here it is in the form they have in the moment of recollection. This strange form it may be called fleeting or eternal is in neither case the stuff that life is made of.
 Walter Benjamin

 Autobiography begins with a sense of being alone. It is an orphan form.

 Everyone must leave something behind when he dies my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted youre there. It doesnt matter what you do he said so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something thats like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching he said. The lawn cutter might just as well not have been there at all the gardener will be there a lifetime.
 Ray Bradbury

 A mans memory is bound to be a distortion of his past in accordance with his present interests and the most faithful autobiography is likely to mirror less what a man was than what he has become.

 No sooner does a great man depart and leave his character as public property than a crowd of little men rushes towards it. There they are gathered together blinking up to it with such vision as they have scanning it from afar hovering round it this way and that each cunningly endeavoring by all arts to catch some reflex of it in the little mirror of himself.
 Thomas Carlyle

 There are people who can write their memoirs with a reasonable amount of honesty and there are people who simply cannot take themselves seriously enough. I think I might be the first to admit that the sort of reticence which prevents a man from exploiting his own personality is really an inverted sort of egotism.

To feel that vanished years have not estranged usdistance has not diminished love that we are to each other even as we parted to feel again the fond kiss to hear once more the accents of a voice which to us has been for years so still a voice that brings with it the gush of memory!

 Like a celestial chaperon the placebo leads us through the uncharted passageways of mind and gives us a greater sense of infinity than if we were to spend all our days with our eyes hypnotically glued to the giant telescope at Mt. Palomar. What we see ultimately is that the placebo isnt really necessary and that the mind can carry out its difficult and wondrous missions unprompted by little pills. The placebo is only a tangible object made essential in an age that feels uncomfortable with intangibles an age that prefers to think that every inner effect must have an outer cause. Since it has size and shape and can be hand held the placebo satisfies the contemporary craving for visible mechanisms and visible answers  The placebo then is an emissary between the will to live and the body.

 Men are not to be told anything they might find too painful the secret depths of human nature the sordid physicalities might overwhelm or damage them.

 Left to itself the masculine imagination has very little appreciation for the here and now it prefers to dwell on what is absent on what has been or may be. If men are more punctual than women it is because they know that without the external discipline of clock time they would never get anything done.
 W. H. Auden

 The masculine imagination lives in a state of perpetual revolt against the limitations of human life. In theological terms one might say that all men left to themselves become gnostics. They may swagger like peacocks but in their heart of hearts they all think sex an indignity and wish they could beget themselves on themselves. Hence the aggressive hostility toward women so manifest in most club car stories.

 In peace we can make many of them ignore good and evil entirely in danger the issue is forced upon them in a guise to which even we cannot blind them. There is here a cruel dilemma before us. If we promoted justice and charity among men we should be playing directly into the Enemys hands but if we guide them to the opposite behaviour this sooner or later produces for He permits it to produce a war or a revolution and the undisguisable issue of cowardice or courage awakes thousands of men from moral stupor.This indeed is probably one of the Enemys motives for creating a dangerous world a world in which moral issues really come to the point. He sees as well as you do that courage is not simply one of the virtues but the form of every virtue at the testing point which means at the point of highest reality. A chastity or honesty or mercy which yieldsto danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions. Pilate was merciful till it became risky.

 I will act now. I will act now. I will act now.

With these words I can condition my mind to perform every action necessary for my success. I will act now. I will repeat these words again and again and again. I will walk where failures fear to walk. I will work when failures seek rest. I will act now for now is all I have. Tomorrow is the day reserved for the labor of the lazy. I am not lazy. Tomorrow is the day when the failure will succeed. I am not a failure. I will act now. Success will not wait. If I delay success will become wed to another and lost to me forever. This is the time. This is the place. I am the person.

Poetry makes nothing happen. It survives in the valley of its saying.
W. H. Auden

If he is too tyrannical they give notice if he lacks authority they become slovenly impertinent drunk and dishonest.
W. H. Auden

As a poet there is only one political duty and that is to defend one s language against corruption. When it is corrupted people lose faith in what they hear and this leads to violence.

I ve read some of your modern free verse and wonder who set it free.
John Barrymore

Who among us has not in moments of ambition dreamt of the miracle of a form of poetic prose musical but without rhythm and rhyme both supple and staccato enough to adapt itself to the lyrical movements of our souls the undulating movements of our reveries and the convulsive movements of our consciences? This obsessive ideal springs above all from frequent contact with enormous cities from the junction of their innumerable connections.
Charles Baudelaire

Poetry and progress are like two ambitious men who hate one another with an instinctive hatred and when they meet upon the same road one of them has to give place.

Charles Baudelaire

The fact that there are so many weak poor and boring stories and novels written and published in America has been ascribed by our rebels to the horrible squareness of our institutions the idiocy of power the debasement of sexual instincts and the failure of writers to be alienated enough. The poems and novels of these same rebellious spirits and their theoretical statements are grimy and gritty and very boring too besides being nonsensical and it is evident by now that polymorphous sexuality and vehement declarations of alienation are not going to produce great works of art either.
Saul Bellow

People cannot stand the saddest truth I know about the very nature of reading and writing imaginative literature which is that poetry does not teach us how to talk to other people it teaches us how to talk to ourselves. What I
Harold Bloom

Poetry is the impish attempt to paint the color of the wind.
Maxwell Bodenheim

In the works of the better poets you get the sensation that they re not talking to people any more or to some seraphical creature. What they re doing is simply talking back to the language itself as beauty sensuality wisdom irony those aspects of language of which the poet is a clear mirror. Poetry is not an art or a branch of art it s something more. If what distinguishes us from other species is speech then poetry which is the supreme linguistic operation is our anthropological indeed genetic goal. Anyone who regards poetry as an entertainment as a read commits an anthropological crime in the first place against himself.
Joseph Brodsky

If a poet has any obligation toward society it is to write well. Being in the minority he has no other choice. Failing this duty he sinks into oblivion. Society on the other hand has no obligation toward the poet. A majority by definition society thinks of itself as having other options than reading verses no matter how well written. Its failure to do so results in its sinking to that level of locution at which society falls easy prey to a demagogue or a tyrant. This is society s own equivalent of oblivion.
Joseph Brodsky

Politics as a practice whatever its professions has always been the systematic organization of hatreds.
Henry Adams

Practical politics consists in ignoring facts.
Henry Adams

Modern politics is at bottom a struggle not of men but of forces. The men become every year more and more creatures of force massed about central powerhouses. The conflict is no longer between the men but between the motors that drive the men and the men tend to succumb to their own motive forces.
Henry Adams

Dick Armey

The biggest problem with politics or running for the governor
Lance Armstrong

He could not see a belt without hitting below it.
Margot Asquith

The belief that politics can be scientific must inevitably produce tyrannies. Politics cannot be a science because in politics theory and practice cannot be separated and the sciences depend upon their separation. Empirical politics must be kept in bounds by democratic institutions which leave it up to the subjects of the experiment to say whether it shall be tried and to stop it if they dislike it because in politics there is a distinction unknown to science between Truth and Justice.
W. H. Auden

My deepest feeling about politicians is that they are dangerous lunatics to be avoided when possible and carefully humored people above all to whom one must never tell the truth.
W. H. Auden

It is as hard and severe a thing to be a true politician as to be truly moral.
Francis Bacon

The apparent rulers of the English nation are like the imposing personages of a splendid procession it is by them the mob are influenced it is they whom the spectators cheer. The real rulers are secreted in second rate carriages no one cares for them or asks after them but they are obeyed implicitly and unconsciously by reason of the splendor of those who eclipsed and preceded them.
Walter Bagehot

A constitutional statesman is in general a man of common opinions and uncommon abilities.
Walter Bagehot

When great questions end little parties begin.
Walter Bagehot

Every political system is an accumulation of habits customs prejudices and principles that have survived a long process of trial and error and of ceaseless response to changing circumstances. If the system works well on the whole it is a lucky accident the luckiest indeed that can befall a society.
Edward C. Banfield

The politician is like an acrobat he keeps his balance By saying the opposite of what he does.

Be brave enough to live creatively. The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition.

I don t care how much a man may consider himself a failure I believe in him for he can change the thing that is wrong in his life any time he is ready and prepared to do it. Whenever he develops the desire he can take away from his life the thing that is defeating it. The capacity for reformation and change lies within.

Marcus Aurelius

Nothing destroys authority more than the unequal and untimely interchange of power stretched too far and relaxed too much.
Francis Bacon

It is a strange desire to seek power and lose liberty or to seek power over others and to lose power over a man s self.

The standing is slippery and the regress is either a downfall or at least an eclipse which is a melancholy thing.

To say the word Romanticism is to say modern art that is intimacy spirituality color aspiration towards the infinite expressed by every means available to the arts.
Charles Baudelaire

The essence of romantic love is that wonderful beginning after which sadness and impossibility may become the rule.

Anita Brookner

No age seemed the age of romance to itself.

Love stories are only fit for the solace of people in the insanity of puberty. No healthy adult human being can really care whether so and so does or does not succeed in satisfying his physiological uneasiness by the aid of some particular person or not.

Romance like a ghost escapes touching it is always where you are not not where you are. The interview or conversation was prose at the time but it is poetry in the memory.

She who makes her husband and her children happy who reclaims the one from vice and trains up the other to virtue is a much greater character than the ladies described in romance whose whole occupation is to murder mankind with shafts from their quiver or their eyes.
Oliver Goldsmith

Romance and novel paint beauty in colors more charming than nature and describe a happiness that humans never taste. How deceptive and destructive are those pictures of consummate bliss!
Oliver Goldsmith

Romance like the rabbit at the dog track is the elusive fake and never attained reward which for the benefit and amusement of our masters keeps us running and thinking in safe circles.
Beverly Jones

And what s romance? Usually a nice little tale where you have everything As You Like It where rain never wets your jacket and gnats never bite your nose and it s always daisy time.
D. H. David Herbert Lawrence

The concept of romantic love affords a means of emotional manipulation which the male is free to exploit since love is the only circumstance in which the female is ideologically pardoned for sexual activity.

Oscar Wilde

Nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humor in the woman.
Oscar Wilde

When one is in love one always begins by deceiving one s self and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.
Oscar Wilde




Melancholy is at the bottom of everything just as at the end of all rivers is the sea. Can it be otherwise in a world where nothing lasts where all that we have loved or shall love must die? Is death then the secret of life? The gloom of an eternal mourning enwraps more or less closely every serious and thoughtful soul as night enwraps the universe.

Joys impregnate. Sorrows bring forth.

Some say that happiness is not good for mortals and they ought to be answered that sorrow is not fit for immortals and is utterly useless to any one a blight never does good to a tree and if a blight kill not a tree but it still bear fruit let none say that the fruit was in consequence of the blight.

Jane Welsh Carlyle

Man s unhappiness as I construe comes of his greatness it is because there is an Infinite in him which with all his cunning he cannot quite bury under the Finite.

Man could not live if he were entirely impervious to sadness. Many sorrows can be endured only by being embraced and the pleasure taken in them naturally has a somewhat melancholy character.
Emile Durkheim

Sadness does not inhere in things it does not reach us from the world and through mere contemplation of the world. It is a product of our own thought. We create it out of whole cloth.

The question of sexual dominance can exist only in the nightmare of that soul which has armed itself totally against the possibility of the changing motion of conquest and surrender which is love.
James Baldwin

The American ideal of sexuality appears to be rooted in the American ideal of masculinity. This idea has created cowboys and Indians good guys and bad guys punks and studs tough guys and softies butch and faggot black and white. It is an ideal so paralytically infantile that it is virtually forbidden as an unpatriotic act that the American boy evolve into the complexity of manhood.
James Baldwin

I believe that organic sex body against body skin area against skin area is becoming no longer possible simply because if anything is to have any meaning for us it must take place in terms of the values and experiences of the media landscape. What we re getting is a whole new order of sexual fantasies involving a different order of experiences like car crashes like travelling in jet aircraft the whole overlay of new technologies architecture interior design communications transport merchandising. These things are beginning to reach into our lives and change the interior design of our sexual fantasies. We ve got to recognize that what one sees through the window of the TV screen is as important as what one sees through a window on the street.
J. G. Ballard

I ve tried several varieties of sex. The conventional position makes me claustrophobic and the others give me a stiff neck or lockjaw.

Eroticism is assenting to life even in death.

Sex pleasure in woman is a kind of magic spell it demands complete abandon if words or movements oppose the magic of caresses the spell is broken.
Simone de Beauvoir

Because her instinct has told her or because she has been reliably informed the faded virgin knows that the supreme joys are not for her she knows by a process of the intellect but she can feel her deprivation no more than the young mother can feel the hardship of the virgin s lot.

I may not be a great actress but I ve become the greatest at screen orgasms. Ten seconds of heavy breathing roll your head from side to side simulate a slight asthma attack and die a little.

Sexual liberation as a slogan turns out to be another kind of bondage. For a woman it offers orgasm as her ultimate and major fulfillment it s better than motherhood.

An isolated outbreak of virginity is a rash on the face of society. It arouses only pity from the married and embarrassment from the single.

When I find myself in the company of scientists I feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into a room full of dukes.
W. H. Auden

Science is but an image of the truth.
Francis Bacon

The events of human life whether public or private are so intimately linked to architecture that most observers can reconstruct nations or individuals in all the truth of their habits from the remains of their public monuments or from their domestic relics. Archaeology is to social nature what comparative anatomy is to organized nature. A mosaic reveals an entire society just as a skeleton of an ichthyosaur suggests an entire creation. Everything is deducible everything is linked. The cause allows one to guess the effect just as each effect allows one to reconstruct a cause. The scientist can resuscitate in this manner even the warts of ancient times. From this comes without doubt the prodigious interest that an architectural description can inspire when the writer s fantasy is faithful to its basic elements. Cannot each person reattach it to its past by rigorous deductions? And as for man does not the past singularly resemble the future? Tell him what was and is this not almost always the same thing as telling him what will be?

Nor was civil society founded merely to preserve the lives of its members but that they might live well for otherwise a state might be composed of slaves or the animal creation... nor is it an alliance mutually to defend each other from injuries or for a commercial intercourse. But whosoever endeavors to establish wholesome laws in a state attends to the virtues and vices of each individual who composes it from whence it is evident that the first care of him who would found a city truly deserving that name and not nominally so must be to have his citizens virtuous.
Aristotle

The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.

Self recognition is necessary to know one s road but knowing the road the price of the mistakes and perils is worth paying. The following of that road will be all the discipline one needs. Discipline does not mean being molded by outside forces but sticking to one s road against the forces that would deflect or bury the soul. People speak of finding one

Our true ancestry is the emergent creativity of the universe. Our forebears were the great inventors who learned how to coalesce hydrogen and helium into stars to form planets to sustain life first from mineral nutrients in the sea and later to capture delicious photons to exploit oxygen for energy rather than be exterminated by it to diversify via sexual reproduction to form social groups for greater security and protection of offspring. We are the beneficiaries and admittedly also the victims of this narrative of emergence. Our companions

I am now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.
Emily Bronte

Society is indeed a contract. It is a partnership in all science a partnership in all art a partnership in every virtue and in all perfection. As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living but between those who are living those who are dead and those who are to be born.
Edmund Burke

Society is now one polished horde formed of two mighty tribes the Bores and Bored.

There are people who think that wrestling is an ignoble sport. Wrestling is not sport it is a spectacle and it is no more ignoble to attend a wrestled performance of suffering than a performance of the sorrows of Arnolphe or Andromaque.

Pierre de Coubertin

So you wish to conquer in the Olympic games my friend? And I too by the Gods and a fine thing it would be! But first mark the conditions and the consequences and then set to work. You will have to put yourself under discipline to eat by rule to avoid cakes and sweetmeats to take exercise at the appointed hour whether you like it or no in cold and heat to abstain from cold drinks and from wine at your will in a word to give yourself over to the trainer as to a physician. Then in the conflict itself you are likely enough to dislocate your wrist or twist your ankle to swallow a great deal of dust or to be severely thrashed and after all these things to be defeated.
Epictetus

In 1883 while I was working at the London Hospital I chanced to turn in to one of D. L. Moody s great tent meetings in the slums of East London. I was amazed to see on the platform with him several men whose athletic prowess was world famous. That was a credential to me that it was worth stopping to listen to what was going to be said. I still believe athletic success is an invaluable asset to a preacher. Christ I am sure wants football baseball and track team men in an age when theological expositions however deep and learned when orthodoxy conventionality or even correct vestments and ritual have so little attraction for the young men who will be leaders tomorrow.

Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter s honor.
Ernest Hemingway

Unlike any other business in the United States sports must preserve an illusion of perfect innocence. The mounting of this illusion defines the purpose and accounts for the immense wealth of American sports. It is the ceremony of innocence that the fans pay to see not the game or the match or the bout but the ritual portrayal of a world in which time stops and all hope remains plausible in which everybody present can recover the blameless expectations of a child where the forces of light always triumph over the powers of darkness.

Joe Montana

Sport in the sense of a mass spectacle with death to add to the underlying excitement comes into existence when a population has been drilled and regimented and depressed to such an extent that it needs at least a vicarious participation in difficult feats of strength or skill or heroism in order to sustain its waning life sense.
Lewis Mumford

People in the States used to think that if girls were good at sports their sexuality would be affected. Being feminine meant being a cheerleader not being an athlete. The image of women is changing now. You don t have to be pretty for people to come and see you play. At the same time if you re a good athlete it doesn t mean you re not a woman.
Martina Navratilova

In sport mental imagery is used primarily to help you get the best out of yourself in training and competition. The developing athletes who make the fastest progress and those who ultimately become their best make extensive use of mental imagery. They use it daily as a means of directing what will happen in training and as a way of pre experiencing their best competition performances.
Terry Orlick

Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred jealousy boastfulness disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence in other words it is war minus the shooting.
George Orwell

Sport inevitably creates deadness of feeling. No one could take pleasure in it who was sensitive to suffering and therefore its pursuit by women is much more to be regretted than its pursuit by men because women pursue much more violently and recklessly what they pursue at all.
